<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p><i>Seven fair and illustrious cities of the dim,
ancient world, Argos, Athen&aelig;, Chios, Colophon,
Salamis, Rhodos, Smyrna, fought a war of
words over <span class="smcap">Homer&rsquo;s</span> birthplace.</i></p>

<p><i>Each claimed the honour.</i></p>

<p><i>And if, indeed, such an accident of chance confers
an honour upon a town, then the birthplace
of the Greatest Poet of all time should be a
place of pilgrimage.</i></p>

<p><i>For, among the weavers of Epos, Drama, and
Romance, he who was called Melesegenes is first
of all and wears an imperishable crown.</i></p>

<p><i>For 3000 years his fame has streamed down the
ages.</i></p>

<p><i>The world has changed. Great empires have
risen, flowered and passed. Christianity came,
flooding mankind with light, at a time when,
though Homer was a dim tradition, his work
was a living force in the world. When Christ
was born, Homerus was dead 900 years.</i></p>

<p><i>A man with such immensity of glory ceases to
be a man. He becomes a Force.</i></p>

<p><i>Of the two imperishable monuments Homer has
left us, the decision of critical scholarship has
placed the <span class="uprt">Iliad</span> first. It has been said that the
<span class="uprt">Iliad</span> is like the midday, the <span class="uprt">Odyssey</span> like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
setting sun. Both are of equal splendour, though
the latter has lost its noonday heat.</i></p>

<p><i>But I would take that adroit simile and draw
another meaning from it.</i></p>

<p><i>When deferred, expected night at last approaches,
when the sun paints the weary west
with fa&euml;ry pictures of glowing seas, of golden
islands hanging in the sky, of lonely magic waterways
unsailed by mortal keels; then, indeed, there
comes into the heart and brain another warmth,&mdash;the
mysterious quickening of Romance.</i></p>

<p><i>For I think that the ringing sound of arms, the
vibrant thriddings of bows, the clash of heroes, are
far less wonderful than the long, lonely wanderings
of Ulysses.</i></p>

<p><i>Through all the <span class="uprt">Odyssey</span> the winds are blowing,
the seas moaning, and the estranged sad spectres
of the night flit noiselessly across the printed page.</i></p>

<p><i>Through new lands, among new peoples&mdash;friends
and foes&mdash;touching at green islands set like
emeralds in wine-coloured seas, the immortal
mariner moves to the music of his creator&rsquo;s verse.
The Sirens&rsquo; voices, the Fairy&rsquo;s enchanted wine, the
Twin Monsters of the Strait pass and are forgotten.</i></p>

<p><i>His wife&rsquo;s tears bid him ever towards home.</i></p>

<p><i>I sometimes have wondered if Vergil thought
of Ulysses when he made his own lesser wanderer
say:&mdash;</i></p>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Per varios casus per tot discrimina rerum,</i><br /></span>

<i>And now, since we are to have, on that so
magical a stage, a concrete picture: since we are
to take away another storied memory from beneath
the copper dome, I feel that the story of Ulysses
may once more be told in English.</i></p>

<p><i>A fine poet, a great player, are to give us an
Ulysses who must perforce be not only full of the
spirit of his own age of myth, but instinct with the
spirit of this.</i></p>

<p><i>That is as inevitable as it is interesting.</i></p>

<p><i>The &ldquo;Gentle Elia&rdquo; (how one wishes one could
find a better name for him&mdash;but custom makes
cowards of us all) has written his own version of
the <span class="uprt">Odyssey</span>. I cannot emulate that. But I think
I can at least be useful.</i></p>

<p><i>There are three stages of knowing Homer: the
time when one dog&rsquo;s ears and dogrells him at
school, the time when one loves him, a literary
love! at Oxford, and the time when the <span class="uprt">va et
vient</span> of life in great capitals wakes the dormant
Ulysses in the heart of every artist, and he begins
to understand.</i></p>

<h2>A BRIEF ACCOUNT<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">OF THE</span><br />
PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS IN THE
WANDERINGS OF ULYSSES, ACCORDING
TO THE ANCIENT WRITERS AND
LEGENDS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Ulysses.</span> The hero of Homer&rsquo;s great poem
was known to the Greeks under the name of
Odysseus. He was king of the pastoral islands
of Ithaca and Dulichium. Most of the petty
Greek chieftains became suitors for the hand of
the beautiful Helen, and Ulysses was among the
number, but withdrew when he realised the
smallness of his chances. He then married
Penelope, the daughter of Icarius, and at the
same time joined with the other unsuccessful
lovers of Helen in a sworn league for her future
protection should she ever stand in need of it.
He then returned to Ithaca with his bride. The
rape of Helen soon compelled him to leave Penelope
and join the other Grecian princes in the
great war against Troy. He endeavoured to
avoid the summons by pretending madness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
Yoking a horse and a bull together, he began
to plough the sands of the sea shore. The
messenger who was sent to him took Telemachus,
the infant son of Ulysses, and placed
the child in the direct course of the plough, in
this way circumventing his design. Ulysses was
one of the most prominent figures during the
Trojan war, his valour, and still more his
cunning, making him of supreme importance
in the councils of the princes. After the Trojan
war Ulysses set sail for home, and at this period
of his career the story of the <i>Odyssey</i> begins.
He was driven by malevolent winds on to the
shores of Africa, where he and his mariners
were captured by the one-eyed giant, Polyphemus,
who ate five of the band. Ulysses
escaped by thrusting a stake into the giant&rsquo;s
eye and then leaving the cave in which he was
confined by crawling under the bellies of the
sheep when the Cyclops led them to pasture.
He next arrives at &AElig;olia, and &AElig;olus gave him,
imprisoned in bags, all the evil winds which
were likely to obstruct his safe return homewards.
The sailors, curious to know what the
bags contained, opened them, and the imprisoned
winds, rushing out with fearful
violence, destroyed the whole fleet save only
the vessel which bore Ulysses. The ship was
thrown on the shores of the Goddess Circe&rsquo;s
enchanted island, and the companions of Ulysses
were changed into swine by the enchantress.
Ulysses escaped the like fate by means of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
magic herb he had received from Mercury, and
forced the goddess to bring his friends to their
original shape. He then yielded to her solicitations
and made her the mother of Telegonus.
The next stage of his adventures brings him to
Hades, where he goes to consult the shade of
the wise Tiresias as to the means of reaching
home in safety. He passes the terrible coasts
of the Sirens unhurt, and escaped the monsters
Scylla and Charybdis by a series of narrow
chances. In Sicily his sailors, urged by extreme
hunger, killed some of Apollo&rsquo;s cattle, and the
Sun-God in revenge destroyed all his companions
and also his ship. Ulysses alone
escaped on a raft and swam to the shores of
an island belonging to Calypso, with whom he
lived a lotos life as husband for seven years.
The gods eventually interfered, and Ulysses,
once more properly equipped, set out on his
travels again. However, Neptune (Poseidon),
the lord of the sea, still remembered the injury
done to his son, the giant Polyphemus, and
wrecked this ship also. Ulysses was cast up
on the island of the Ph&oelig;acians, where he was
hospitably received by King Alcinous and his
daughter the Princess Nausicaa, and at last sent
home in safety to his own kingdom after an
absence of more than twenty years. The
Goddess Athene befriended him, and informed
him that his palace was crowded with debauched
and insolent suitors for the hand of
Queen Penelope, but that his wife was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
faithful and unceasingly mourned his loss.
Adopting the advice of the goddess, he disguised
himself in rags to see for himself the
state of his home. He then slew the suitors
and lived quietly at home for the remaining
sixteen years of his adventurous life. Tradition
says that he at last met his death at the
hands of his illegitimate son Telegonus.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span> A famous Gr&aelig;cian princess, wife
of Ulysses. She married at about the same time
that Helen wedded King Menelaus, and returned
home to Ithaca with her husband against the
wishes of her father Icarius of Sparta. During
the long absence of Ulysses she was besieged
by suitors for her hand, who established themselves
in the palace. She became practically
their prisoner, and was compelled to dissimulate
and put them off by various excuses. She
managed to keep her importunate guests in
some sort of good humour by giving out that
she would make a choice among them as soon
as she had completed a piece of tapestry on
which she was engaged. Each night she undid
the stitches she had worked in the daytime.
On the return of Ulysses she was, of course,
freed from the suitors by her husband. According
to some ancient writers, after the death of
Ulysses she married Telegonus, Ulysses&rsquo; son
by the Goddess Circe. Her name Penelope
sprung from some river-birds who were called
&ldquo;Penelopes.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Telemachus.</span> The son of Ulysses and Penelope.
When his father left for the Trojan war
Telemachus was but an infant, but at the close
of the campaign he went to seek him and to
obtain what information he could about his
father&rsquo;s absence. When Ulysses returned home
in disguise Athene brought son and parent together,
and the two concerted means to rid the
palace of the suitors. After the death of Ulysses,
Telemachus is said to have gone to the island
of Circe and married the enchantress, formerly
his father&rsquo;s mistress. A son called Latinus
sprung from this union.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Athene</span> (Minerva). The Goddess of
Wisdom was born from Zeus&rsquo; brain without
a mother. She sprang from his head in
full armour. She was the most powerful of
the goddesses and the friend of mankind.
She was the patroness of Ulysses, and it
was believed she first invented ships. Her
chastity was inviolable. Her worship was
universal.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Zeus</span> (Jupiter). Chief of all the gods. His
attitude towards Ulysses was friendly owing to
the persuasion of his daughter Athene.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Poseidon</span> (Neptune) was the Sea God and
next in power to Zeus. He was the father of
the giant Polyphemus whom Ulysses blinded,
and is the consistent enemy of Ulysses throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
the whole <i>Odyssey</i>. Neptune was the brother
of Zeus.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Hermes</span> (Mercury) was the messenger of
the gods and a son of Zeus. He was
especially the patron of travellers and well
disposed to Ulysses.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Tiresias</span> was in life a celebrated soothsayer
and philosopher of Thebes. His wisdom
was universal. Having inadvertently seen the
Goddess Athene bathing in the fountain of
Hippocrene, he was blinded. Ulysses visited
his spirit in Hades, in order to obtain
his advice as to the journey homewards to
Ithaca.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span> An enchantress celebrated for her
knowledge of the magic properties of herbs.
She was of extreme personal beauty. In girlhood
she married the prince of Colchis, whom
she murdered to obtain his kingdom. She was
thereon banished to the fairy island of &AElig;&aelig;a.
When Ulysses visited her shores she changed
his companions into swine, but Ulysses was
protected by the magic virtues of a herb called
<i>moly</i>. Ulysses spent a year in the arms of
Circe, and she gave birth to a son called
Telegonus.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Calypso.</span> One of the daughters of Atlas, was
known as the &ldquo;bright-haired Goddess of Silence,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
and was queen of the lost island of Ogygia.
Ulysses spent seven years with her, and she
bore him two sons. By order of Zeus, Hermes
was sent to the island ordering Ulysses to leave
his voluptuous sloth, and Calypso, who was inconsolable
at his loss, was forced to allow him
to depart. The legend runs that the goddess
offered him the gift of immortality if he would
remain with her.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Scylla</span> and <span class="smcap">Charybdis</span>. Scylla was a terrible
female monster who devoured six of Ulysses&rsquo;
crew, though the hero himself escaped her.
Below the waist she was composed of creatures
like dogs who never ceased barking. She was
supported by twelve feet and had six different
heads. The monster dwelt in a cave under the
sea on one side of a narrow strait off the coast
of Sicily. On the other side of the strait was
the great whirlpool <span class="smcap">Charybdis</span>. It was invested
with a personality by Homer, and Charybdis
was said to be a giantess who sucked down
ships as they passed.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">The Sirens.</span> Monsters with sweet alluring
voices who inhabited a small island near Sicily.
They had bodies like great birds, according to
some writers, with the heads of beautiful women.
Whosoever heard their magic song must go to
them and remain with them for ever. Ulysses
escaped the enchantment by causing himself to
be bound to the ship&rsquo;s mast.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Polyphemus.</span> The son of Poseidon. He
was the giant king of the Cyclopes who were
workers in the forge of Vulcan and made
armour for the gods. Ulysses and his companions
blinded him in order to escape from
the cavern where he had imprisoned them.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Antinous.</span> A native gentleman of Ithaca,
one of Penelope&rsquo;s most persistent suitors.
When Ulysses came home disguised as a
beggar Antinous struck him. He was the first
to fall by Ulysses&rsquo; bow.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Euryclea.</span> The nurse of Ulysses in his
infancy, and one of the first to recognise him
on his return from his wanderings. She was in
her youth the lovely daughter of Ops of
Ithaca.</p>


<p class="smlpadt"><span class="smcap">Eum&aelig;us.</span> The herdsman and steward of
Ulysses who knew his master on his return
after an absence of twenty years. He was the

<p class="xlrgfont">THE ADVENTURES OF ULYSSES</p>



<h2>THE FIRST EPISODE<br />
<br />
<span class="smltitle">How They blinded the Son of Poseidon</span></h2>


<p>A warm mild wind, laden with sweet scents, blew
over the sailors from the island, which now lay far
astern.</p>

<p>In the weary west the charmed sunset still
lingered over Lotus Land.</p>

<p>A rosy flush lay on the snow-capped mountains
which were yet spectral in the last lights of the
day, but looking out over the bows the sky was
dark purple changing into black, and where it met
the sea there was a white gleam of foam.</p>

<p>The companions of Ulysses sat idle from the
oars, for the wind filled the belly of the sail and
there was no need for rowing. A curious silence
brooded over them all. No one spoke to his
fellow. The faces of all were sad, and in the eyes of
some the fire of an unutterable regret burnt steadily.</p>

<p>The heads of all were turned towards the island,
which was fast disappearing from their view.
Some of the men shaded their eyes with their
hands in one last long look of farewell.</p>

<p>As the curtain of the dark fell upon the sea, the
warm offshore wind died away. A colder breeze,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
full of the sea-smell itself, came down over the
port bow; it moaned through the cordage, and
little waves began to hiss under the cutwater.</p>

<p>Every now and again the wind freshened rapidly.
The mournful whistling became a sudden snarling
of trumpets. The ship and crew seemed to have
passed over the limits of a tableau. Not only was
it a quick elemental change of scene, but the
change had its influence with the spectators.</p>

<p>The sad fire&mdash;if the glow of regret is indeed a
fire&mdash;died out of heavy eyes half veiled by
weary lids. The sea-light dawned once more
upon the faces of the mariners, the bright warm
blood moved swiftly in their veins.</p>

<p>One man ran to the steering oar to give an aid
to the helmsman as the ship went about on the
starboard tack, three more stood by the sheet, a
hum of talk rose from the waist of the boat.
Ulysses stood in the bows looking forward into the
night. His tall, lean figure was bent forward, and
his arm was thrown round the gilded boss of the
prow. His eyes were deep set in his head, and his
brow was furrowed with the innumerable wrinkles
which come to the man who lives a life of hardship
and striving.</p>

<p>Yet the long years of battle and wandering, a
life of shocks! had only intensified the alertness
of his pose. He seemed, as he looked out into the
night, a personification of &ldquo;readiness.&rdquo; A crisp
dark beard grew round his throat, and the veins on
his bare brown arms were like blue enamel round
a column of bronze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
When the ship went about again he came down
into the body of the ship and helped to pull upon
the brace. Though he was no taller than many of
his men, and leaner than most, in physical strength
as well as in intellect he was first and chief. The
mighty muscles leapt up on his arms as he strained
on the taut rope.</p>

<p>The ship slanted away down the wind into the
night. The men gathered round their captain.
&ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; he said to them in a singularly sweet
and musical voice, &ldquo;once more we adventure the
deep, and no man knows what shall befall us. To
our island home in the west, to dear Ithaca! if the
gods so will it. Our wives weep for us on our deserted
hearthstone. Our little ones are noble youths
ere now, and may Zeus bring us safe home at last.
Yet much it misdoubts me that there are other
perils in store for us ere we hear the long breakers
beat upon the shores of Ithaca and see the morning
sun run down the wooded sides of Neriton.
Be that as the Fates will it, let us keep always
courage, gaiety, and the quiet mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are well away from there,&rdquo; said one of the
men, nodding vaguely towards the stern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That are we,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;that cursed fruit
is honeysweet in my mouth still. It stole away
our brains and made us as women, we! the men
who fought in Troyland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what profit is it to look to the past,
Phocion?&rdquo; said Ulysses. &ldquo;We did eat and sleep
and forget, but it is over. The sea wind is salt
once more upon our faces. Let us eat the night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
meal, and then I will choose a watch and the rest
may sleep. Hand me the cup&mdash;To to-morrow&rsquo;s
dawn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then one of the sailors took dried goat&rsquo;s flesh
and fruit from a locker in the stern, and by the
light of a torch of sawn sandal wood they fell to
eating. Great bunches of purple grapes lay before
each sailor, but they had brought none of the
magic lotus fruit with them to steal away their
vigour and thicken their blood.</p>

<p>Then they lay down to sleep under coverings of
skins. Two men went to the great steering oar,
three men watched amidship by the braces, and
Ulysses himself wrapped a woollen cloak round
him and went once more into the bows.</p>

<p>Alone there with the wind his thoughts once
more went back to his far distant home. He
thought with longing of his old father Laertes, of
the child Telemachus playing in the marble courtyard
of the sunny palace on the hill. A deep
sigh shuddered out from his lips as his thoughts
fell upon the lonely Queen Penelope. &ldquo;Wife of
mine,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;shall I ever lie beside you
more? Is there silver in your bright hair now?
Are your thoughts to mewards as mine to you?
Perchance another rules in my palace and sits at
my seat. Are your lips another&rsquo;s now? The
great tears are blinding me. Courage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bending his head upon his breast, Ulysses
prayed long and earnestly to his awful patroness,
the Goddess Athene, that she would still keep
ward over his fortunes and guide him safely home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
The night wore on and became very silent. The
ship seemed to be moving swiftly and surely,
though the wind had dropped and the voice of the
waves was hushed. It seemed to the watcher in
the bows that the ship was moving in the path of
some strong current.</p>

<p>A curious white mist suddenly rolled over the
still surface of the sea, thick and ghostly. The
mast and sail, which was now drooping and lifeless,
swayed through it like giant spectres.
Ulysses could see none of his companions, but
when he hailed the watch the voice of Phocion
came back to him through the ghostly curtain,
curiously thick and muffled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mist thickens, my captain,&rdquo; said the
sailor. &ldquo;Can you see aught ahead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see nothing, Phocion,&rdquo; shouted Ulysses;
&ldquo;the mist is like wool. But I think it is a land
mist come out to meet us. There should be land
ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear no surf or the rolling of waves,&rdquo; said
Phocion. &ldquo;May Zeus guide the boat, for mortal
men are of no avail to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ship moved on swiftly as if guided by invisible
hands towards some goal, and still the
expectant mariners heard no sound.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly, and without the slightest warning,
a vivid copper-coloured flash of lightning
illuminated the ship. For an instant in the hard
lurid light Ulysses saw the whole of the vessel in
a distinct picture.</p>

<p>Every detail was manifest&mdash;the mast, the cordage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
the sleeping sailors below, the watching group
by the shrouds, and, right away astern, the startled
helmsmen motionless as statues of bronze.</p>

<p>Then with a long grinding noise the ship seemed
suddenly lifted up in the water, jerked forward, and
then dropped again. She began to heel over a
little out of the perpendicular, and then remained
still, stranded upon an unknown and mysterious
shore, where the waves were all asleep. Still
the white mist circled round them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; said Ulysses, &ldquo;we are brought here
by no chance of wind and waves. Some god has
done this thing, but whether for weal or woe I
cannot tell. Let us land upon the beach and lie
down with our weapons within sound of the sea
till dawn. At sunrise we shall know where the
god has brought us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They landed at the order, and with the supreme
indifference of the adventurer lay upon the shore
and slept out the remainder of the night. But
Ulysses had a prescience of harm, and was full
of sinister forebodings. He did not sleep, but
paced through the mist all night in a little beaten
track among the boulders. He prayed long and
earnestly to Athene.</p>

<p>When the first faint hintings of dawn brightened
through the mist a little breeze arose, and before
the sky was more than faintly flushed with day
the night fog was blown away like thistledown.</p>

<p>As the sun climbed up the sky the companions
found that they had been carried to a scene of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
singular beauty. They were on an island, a small,
rich place at the mouth of a great bay. Rich level
grass meadows, green as bright enamel and brilliant
with flowers, sloped gently down to the violet sea.
Behind was a thickly-wooded hill, at the foot of
which was a sparkling spring surrounded by a
tall grove of poplar trees.</p>

<p>In the leafy wood the wild goats leapt under the
wild vine trees like Pan at play, as fearless of the
intruders as if they had never seen men before.
All the bright morning the sailors made the wood
ring with happy laughter as they speared the goats
for a feast. All trouble passed from their minds,
and as the spears flashed swiftly through the
green wood the shrill, jocund voices of the hunters
made all the island musical. Ulysses plunged
into a translucent pool at the foot of the spring,
and the cool water flashed like diamonds over his
strong brown arms, and he looked indeed as if he
were some river-god and this his fairy home.</p>

<p>All day long they feasted and drank wine which
they had brought in skins from Lotus Land. When
night was falling, very still and gentle, they saw
the blue smoke of fires over the bay, on the mainland,
about a mile away, and the bleating of many
sheep and the lowing of herds came to them over
the wine-coloured sea.</p>

<p>Ever and again voices could be heard&mdash;strange
resonant voices. &ldquo;That must be the country of
some strange gods,&rdquo; the sailors said to each other.
&ldquo;Those are no mortal voices. We are come into
some great peril.&rdquo; Before they slept they sacrificed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
a goat on the seashore to Zeus, that he
might guard them from any coming harm.</p>

<p>In the morning the king prepared for action.
It was necessary to find upon what shores they
had arrived, to get direction of Ithaca, and if
treasure was to be won by force or guile, to
take the opportunity which chance or the gods
had sent.</p>

<p>Ulysses chose twelve of his men, tried veterans
with nerves of steel, old comrades who had fought
with him for Helen on the windy plains of Troy.
With these old never-strikes he embarked on the
ship. He left Phocion as leader of the remainder
of the crew, and taking Elpenor with him as
second in command, they got out six sweeps, three
on each side of the ship, and rowed slowly over the
glassy bay.</p>

<p>The mainland, on the shore where they landed,
was a wild rocky place, and there was a broad
road winding away up to the higher pasture lands.
The road was made of great rocks beaten into
smoothness, and fresh spoor of cattle showed that
not long since a great herd had passed to the upland
feeding grounds.</p>

<p>Directly in front of them as they landed was a
high cave. It was fringed with laurel bushes, which
grew on ledges in the cliff side.</p>

<p>Before the cave a great wall had been built in a
square, forming a courtyard. The wall was built
with enormous masses of rock, and fenced with a
palisade of pine trunks and massive boles of oak.
There was no sign of any living thing. Slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
and cautiously the party crept up to the wall.
Their weapons were in readiness as they stole
through the gateway. Within the square formed
by the wall they could see that it was a vast cattle
pen. &ldquo;This must be the dwelling of some giant,&rdquo;
said Elpenor; &ldquo;men do not build like this. On
what strange place have we chanced?&rdquo; He looked
inquiringly at Ulysses when he had spoken, and
a ring of eager faces turned towards him whose
wisdom was never at fault, the favourite of
Athene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, comrades,&rdquo; said Ulysses, &ldquo;that we
have been driven to the shores of the Cyclopes.
They are mighty giants, who work in the forge
of Vulcan making armour for the gods. Now
this cave must be the dwelling of one of them, and
I like not where we are. Let us but go within for a
short time and take what we can find, and then
hasten back to the island. The Cyclopes have no
boats and cannot follow us. But it would go hard
with us were we found, for they are crafty and
cruel monsters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With hasty, curious footsteps they crossed the
echoing flags of the courtyard and entered the
cave. As the shadow of the entrance fell upon
them and the chill of the air inside struck on their
faces, more than one would have gladly stayed in
the warm outside sunshine. It was an ill-omened,
sinister place this lair of giants.</p>

<p>A pungent ammoniacal smell made them
cough and shudder as they crossed the threshold.
Ulysses turned with a grim smile to his followers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thank the gods we are seamen and sons of the
fresh wind. This Cyclops lives like a swine in a
stye.&rdquo; The large entrance to the cave gave a
fair light within, and their eyes soon became accustomed
to it. Along one side of the cave were
folds of fat lambs and kids who bleated lustily
at them. At the end of the cave was a great
couch of skins by the ashes of a pine fire. Bones
and scraps of flesh were piled round, relics of some
great orgy, and a sickly stench of decay came from
the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>.</p>

<p>Piles of wicker baskets were loaded with huge
yellow cheeses, and there were many copper milk
pails and bowls brimful of whey.</p>

<p>The sailors rejoiced at such an abundance of
good cheer, and they killed one of the fattest of the
lambs and lit a fire to roast it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The giant will not return till even,&rdquo; said
Elpenor, &ldquo;and by then we shall be far away. We
will make a good meal now, and then load the ship
with cheeses and drive off the best of the lambs.
Our comrades will welcome us home this night, for
we shall be full-handed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, careless of danger, they sat them down in
that perilous place and made merry on the giant&rsquo;s
cheer. They had brought skins of wine with them,
and they drank in mockery to their absent host.</p>

<p>In the middle of the feast one of the men
suddenly laid down his cup. &ldquo;Hearken,&rdquo; he
said uneasily, &ldquo;do you hear anything, friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear nothing,&rdquo; said Ulysses. &ldquo;What sound
did you hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
&ldquo;A distant sound, I thought,&rdquo; answered the
man, &ldquo;as if the earth shook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; said a third at length; but
a certain constraint fell upon them all, and
anxiety clouded their faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us begone,&rdquo; said Ulysses at length. &ldquo;There
is what I do not like in the air. I fear evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had but hardly made an end of speaking
when all of them there were struck rigid with
apprehension. A distant but rapidly-nearing
sound assailed their ears, a heavy crunching sound
like the blows of a great hammer upon the earth,
save that each succeeding blow was louder than
the last. They stood irresolute for one fatal
moment, and then started to run towards the
mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>The noise filled all the air, which hummed and
trembled with it. They reached the entrance, but
too late. Even as the first man came out into
the afternoon sunlight, a great herd of cattle came
pouring into the courtyard. Behind them, towering
over the wall, as tall as the tallest pine on
the slopes of Hymettus, strode Polyphemus, the
giant king of the Cyclopes, son of the God
Poseidon.</p>

<p>The giant was naked to the waist, where he wore
a girdle of skins. One great eye burned in the
centre of his forehead, and a row of sharp, white
teeth were framed by thick dribbling lips, like the
lips of a cow.</p>

<p>Under his arm Polyphemus carried a bundle of
young sapling trees, which he had brought for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
faggots for his fire. He threw them on the floor of
the courtyard by the mouth of the cave with a
great crash. The adventurers crouched away at
the back of the cave in the darkness as the giant
entered.</p>

<p>He drove all the ewes of his flock before him,
leaving the rams outside in the court. Then he
took a great hole of rock, which scarce twenty
teams of horses could have moved, and closed the
mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>With a great sigh of weariness, which echoed
like a hissing wind and blew the silent bats which
hung to the roof this way and that in a frightened
eddy of wings, he sank down upon his couch of
skins. The giant had brought some of the firewood
into the cave with him and he threw it into
the embers.</p>

<p>A resinous piece of wood suddenly caught the
flame and flared up, filling the cavern with red
light. One of the sailors dropped his spear with
a loud clatter as the flames made plain the figure
of the monster.</p>

<p>Polyphemus turned his head and saw them.</p>

<p>He stared steadily at them with his single eye
for full a minute. A cruel smile played on his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you, strangers?&rdquo; he said at length,
in a thick, low voice like the swell of a great
organ. &ldquo;Merchants, are you? Pirates? And
whence come you along the paths of the sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses spoke in a smooth voice of conciliation.
&ldquo;We are Greeks, oh lord, soldiers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
Agamemnon&rsquo;s army, bound for home over the seas
from Troy. Bad weather has driven us out of
our course, and so we have come to you and beg
you to be our honoured host. Oh, great lord,
have reverence for the gods, for Zeus himself is
the god of hospitality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the giant smiled cunningly. &ldquo;You are
a man of little wit, stranger,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or else
you have indeed come from the very end of the
world. I pay no heed to Zeus, for I am stronger
than he. But now, tell me, where is your
ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ulysses, the wary one, saw the snare and
answered humbly, &ldquo;The great Poseidon, god
of the deep, wrecked our ship upon the rocks,
and we alone survive of all our company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant looked fixedly at the trembling band
for a moment. Then, with a sudden movement,
he snatched among the mariners and grasped
two of them in his mighty hand.</p>

<p>The swift horror remained with them in all their
after life. He stripped the clothes from each like
a man strips the scales from a prawn with one
quick twirl of his fingers.</p>

<p>Then he dashed the quivering bodies upon the
ground so that the yellow paste of the brains
smeared the stone&mdash;save for the horrid crunching
of bone and flesh, and the liquid gurgle of the
monster&rsquo;s throat as he made his frightful meal,
there was no sound in the cave.</p>

<p>Then he fell into a foul sleep.</p>

<p>Three times during the long night did Ulysses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
draw his sword to plunge it into the monster&rsquo;s
heart, three times did he sheathe it again. For
in his wisdom he knew that if he killed Polyphemus
no one could ever move away the great
stone which shut them from the outside world.</p>

<p>In the morning Elpenor and one other died, and
the giant drove his flocks to pasture and closed
up the heroes in the cave.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses comforted the dying hearts of
his men, and as Polyphemus strode away over
the hills whistling to his cattle, he made a plan
for one last bid for freedom.</p>

<p>Leaning against the wall of the cave was a
great club of hard wood which the monster had
put there to dry. It was an olive-tree trunk as
big as the great spar of a ship.</p>

<p>This they took and sharpened with their swords,
and hardened it in the flame of the fire and hid
it carefully away. Then very sadly the sailors
cast lots as to who should be the four to help the
captain. All day long they sat in the f&oelig;tid cave
and prayed to the gods for an alms of aid. And
their hearts were leaden for love of their valiant
comrades.</p>

<p>At eventime two more heroes died.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses rose, and though his knees were
weak and his face blanched with agony, he spoke
in a smooth voice. &ldquo;My Lord Cyclops,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I have filled this bowl with wine which we
brought with us. I pray you drink, and perchance
your heart may be touched and you will let us go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the giant took the bowl from the king, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
as Ulysses went near him his breath reeked of
carrion and blood. He drank the wine, which
was a sweet and drowsy vintage from the Lotus
Island. &ldquo;Give me more,&rdquo; he cried thickly, &ldquo;and
say how you are named, for I will grant you a
favour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ulysses filled the bowl for him three times.
&ldquo;Oh, my lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my friends and parents
call me Noman, for that is my name. Now, great
lord, your boon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant leered at the hero with drunken
cunning. &ldquo;Noman, since that is your name
Noman, you shall die last of all, and the others
first. That is your boon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And once more he sank into his sleep, gorged
with blood and wine.</p>

<p>The hours wore on and the flames of the fire
sank into a bright red glow. The loud stertorous
breathing of the monster became more deep and
regular. Very silently the five rose from among
the rest and stole towards the fire with the great
stake. They pressed it into the heart of the white
hot embers and sat watching it change from black
to crimson, while little sparks ran up and down
the sides like flies upon the wall.</p>

<p>When the spar was just about to burst into
flame they drew it out, and with quick, nervous
footsteps carried it to where Polyphemus lay
sleeping. The glow from the hot hard wood
played upon that vast blood-smeared countenance
and the yellow wrinkled lid which veiled
the cruel eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
Ulysses directed the point to the exact centre
of the foul skin, and then with their old battle
cry of &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; the five heroes pressed it home
through the hissing, steaming eyeball, turning it
round and round until everything was burned
away.</p>

<p>They had just time to leap aside when the giant
rose in horrid agony. His cries of rage and pain
were like the cries of a thousand tortured beasts,
and the din was so great that pieces of rock began
to fall from the roof of the cave. He spun round
in his torture, beating upon the walls with his arms
and head until they were a raw and bleeding
wound.</p>

<p>At this awful sound mighty footsteps were heard
outside the cave as the other giants rushed down
from the hills. There came great and terrible
voices shouting together, and it was as though a
great storm was racing through the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails you, brother, that you call us from
sleep in the night?&rdquo; cried the giants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! help! brothers. Noman is murdering
me. I die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A chorus of thunderous laughter came rolling
back. &ldquo;If Noman harms thee, then how should
we aid thee, brother? &rsquo;Tis the gods who have sent
thee a sickness which thou must endure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now, through an aperture high up in the
cave, the light began to whiten, and showed day
was at hand. The footsteps of the Cyclopes grew
faint and ceased, but Polyphemus lay moaning by
the great stone which closed the entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
The morning light grew stronger, and a breeze
stole in, fresh and clean, and played upon the faces
of the prisoners.</p>

<p>The ewes began to bleat, for their milking time
was at hand, and the rams cried out for freedom
and the green pastures of the hill.</p>

<p>The giant moved aside the stone to let them go
and in the morning sunlight the sailors could see
that he felt over them with his hands so that no
men should mingle with them and so escape.</p>

<p>First the ewes went out and then the young
rams, and last of all the great old rams, patriarchs
of the flock, began to move slowly towards the
door.</p>

<p>Then courage came back to Ulysses, and with it
all his cunning. Stooping low under the belly of
a great beast, he motioned to his friends to do
likewise, and, slowly, in this way, holding to the
fleece of the rams, they moved out of the cave.
They could feel the rams tremble when the giant&rsquo;s
hands ranged over the wool of their backs, but
nevertheless they came safely out into the light,
and stole down to where their ship yet lay at
anchor.</p>

<p>The air of the morning was like wine to them,
and the face of the water as dear as the face of a
well-beloved wife as they ran over the bright
yellow sand.</p>

<p>Then from the stern of the boat Ulysses cried
out in a great voice of triumph. At that sound
the monster came stumbling from his cave, reeling
like a drunken man, and calling on his father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
Poseidon, Lord of the Sea, to avenge him on his
enemies. He took up the stone that had barred
the cave and threw it far out into the water, but it
overshot the boat and did not harm the heroes,
though the wave of its descent flung the ship from
side to side as if it were a piece of driftwood.
The mariners bent to the oars, and the vessels
moved away from that accursed shore, slowly at
first but more swiftly as their tired arms grew
strong with the chance of safety, and the wine of
hope flowed in their veins once more.</p>

<p>They saw the sightless face of Polyphemus
working horribly, his mouth opening and shutting
like a dying fish as he looked heavenwards and
implored his mighty father&rsquo;s aid.</p>

<p>And after a space of mourning for the brave
dead the heroes set out again over the sad grey
seas, seeking Ithaca.</p>

<p>But the heart of King Ulysses was sick and
weary, for he dreaded the wrath to come, and most
of all he longed for home.</p>

<h2>THE SECOND EPISODE<br />
<br />
<span class="smltitle">The Adventure of the Palace in the
Wood</span></h2>


<p>Ulysses slowly mounted the wooded hill. The
path which rose towards the summit wound in and
out through thick undergrowth, and his feet made
no sound upon the green moss of the track.</p>

<p>He had his spear ready for any game that he
might chance on, but for half a day he saw no
living thing save a few mailed lizards that lay
open-eyed upon a stone.</p>

<p>No birds twittered in the forest on the mountainside,
only the wild bees sang in the stillness like
jewels with voices.</p>

<p>How beautiful the wood was! and how mysterious
also. Ulysses felt a quickening of the pulses
which did not come from fear, and a strange excitement
possessed him which arose from he knew
not what cause.</p>

<p>The trees in the forest were very old and grew
thickly together. The trunks were painted delicate
greens, greys and browns by lichens, and the foliage
overhead met and made a roof of bright leaves.
Beneath this canopy there was a sort of twilight
like the gloom in the temple of Zeus at Sparta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
Ulysses toiled on and up. After a time the
trees began to open out and grow less thickly.
The moss-carpet began to be rocky and uneasy to
walk upon, so that Ulysses knew that he must be
nearing the top.</p>

<p>At last he climbed a few worn boulders and
stood alone upon the peak. From that great
height he could discern the sea on all sides of the
island. Beyond the thick woodlands below, the
yellow sands of the shore went out to meet the
water, and the king could see the ship riding at
anchor and a small boat plying from it to a tiny
group of black dots upon the beach.</p>

<p>Ulysses sent his gaze circling slowly over the
unbroken green of the woods. When his roving
glance fell upon the very centre of the island he
started suddenly and shaded his eyes from the
sunlight with both hands. A thick column of blue
smoke was rising from among the trees, and looking
more intently than before he could see the
gleam of white marble here and there through the
greenwood, and catch the sunlight glinting upon
copper.</p>

<p>He had learned what he came to know; there
was life upon the island. But of what kind?
Did some fearful monster lurk yonder, three miles
away in the forest. Another Cyclops, perchance,
or some angry god wroth at a disturbance of his
privacy.</p>

<p>The still smoke rose into the soft air and a great
calm seemed to brood over the place. No birds
flew about the roofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
He began to retrace his steps down towards his
comrades on the shore to tell them what he had
seen.</p>

<p>The wood was as still as before, but when he
came to the meadow lands below he dropped
quickly behind a clump of fern, for his keen eyes
had seen a smooth brown flank not far away. A
great stag was drinking at a little stream which
sang its way down from the mountain to the sea.
They had touched at the island with very little
food left, and the king had promised that he would
return with spoils from hunting.</p>

<p>Just as the beast raised his head from the water
the spear flashed like a gleam of light from the
clump of fern, and the quarry stumbled, clattering
among the stones with a sob.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses made a rope of willow twigs and
tied the stag&rsquo;s feet together and brought him to
the ship.</p>

<p>Only half the crew were upon the shore, for the
rest had gone to explore the inward parts of the
island with Eurylochus as their leader.</p>

<p>They skinned the stag and made a fire, and
roasted the sweet flesh upon their spear points.
While they sat eating, a man with a white face
came running over the shore towards them, and as
they saw him come they rose with their arms in
fear, for they knew that once more they had come
to some dangerous and evil place, and that a
deadly peril lurked in the forest.</p>

<p>They saw he who ran was Eurylochus, and that
he ran in terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
But none followed him in pursuit, nor did any
arrow come singing like a bee from the shelter of
the neighbouring trees.</p>

<p>Eurylochus rushed up to them and sank exhausted
by the fire. Ulysses gave him wine, and
motioned the others to ask no questions but to let
the man tell his tale in his own way. For he
knew it would be more vivid so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More evil, comrades!&rdquo; he sobbed out at last,
&ldquo;and good men and true lost to us for ever.
Know you where we have landed? This accursed
place is &AElig;&aelig;a, the home of the Goddess Circe, and
I have seen her face to face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ulysses started violently, and despair crept into
his eyes as he motioned Eurylochus to proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We went up through the valleys,&rdquo; said the
lieutenant, &ldquo;and entered the wood. After we had
walked long, and were thirsty and weary, we came
to an open glade in which stood the house of Circe.
It was built of polished marble with copper roofs,
and the trees made a thick wall on all sides of the
glade. A very strange, silent place! All round
the house were lions and mountain wolves playing
with each other. We turned to fly in fear, but the
beasts fawned upon us with gentle paws and waving
tails, and we saw their eyes were sad and tame, and
they were all unlike the beasts of the field. They
were as dogs at supper begging for food from their
masters. But it was an awful sight nevertheless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, as we stood waiting in the porch, we
heard a sweet low song inside the palace, sweeter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
than any mortal song, like the flutes and harps of
the gods. Then we looked in, and we saw the
goddess weaving at a golden loom, and going up
and down before it as she sang. And Polites&mdash;oh,
dear Polites!&mdash;called out to her, and the song
ceased, and Circe came out to us, and bade us
enter, and her beauty was like moonlight. Then
the men went in, but I remained, mindful of the
Cyclops and fearing harm. So I sat down in the
wood, and the beasts played round me, and the
lions licked my hands with their hard rough
tongues. But I could see what was toward in the
palace hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goddess led them to rich couches and chairs,
and she prepared a drink for them of golden honey
and purple wine, white fresh cheese, and meal of
corn. But she poured a brew of magic herbs
into the drink, and when they had passed the bowl
from hand to hand and drunk she waved a wand
of cedar wood over them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped, choking with emotion and shaking
with horror at what he had seen. He covered his
face with his hands.</p>

<p>Ulysses placed a firm hand upon his shoulder,
and he took up his tale once more. &ldquo;And when
she waved her wand behold a horror! For
suddenly my comrades dwindled, and were changed
to swine. The bristles of swine grew out upon
them, and they grunted like swine, but still the
souls of men shone out of their eyes. And she
drove them away into a pen, and threw them
beech nuts, laughing most musically. And I,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
the unhappy one, fled and am come hither with
my tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ulysses rose with a pale set face, and stern hard
lines flashed out round his lips. For a moment he
prayed in silence to Athene. Then he slung his
strung bow upon his shoulder, and loosened the
arrows in the quiver, testing each one for a flaw in
the shaft. He took his great silver-studded sword
and buckled it round his waist. &ldquo;I alone, my
comrades, must go to the palace of the enchantress,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I have no choice but to
go and strive. May the gods preserve you,
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was preparing to move away when they all
entreated him to remain with them, but he would
not listen, and as he moved away and was lost to
their sight they broke out into loud praises of him
among themselves.</p>

<p>It was ever thus. Their father and captain was
first in wisdom and courage, and had always seemed
to them more god than man.</p>

<p>Ulysses passed over the meadows with slow sure
step, thinking deeply. The forest closed about
him, dark and lonely, and his walk changed. He
became alert, walking warily and softly. His keen
eyes roved over the untrodden paths, seeking to
pierce the mystery of the greenwood.</p>

<p>He had halted by a brook for a moment, debating
which path he should venture, when help
came to him.</p>

<p>There was a crash in the tree tops above him,
a glittering ball of light fell through the green,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
and a wind rushed among the leaves, suddenly
rousing all the voices of the wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<a name="palace" id="palace"></a>
<img src="images/utw03.jpg" width="405" height="600"

<p class="caption">THEN HE CAME SWIFTLY UPON THE GLEAMING PALACE.</p>
<p class="refnote"><i>Page <a href="#Page_45">45</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A young and beautiful man, holding a golden
rod, with a slight down upon his lip, came towards
him.</p>

<p>Ulysses knew that the God Hermes had flashed
down from heaven to be his counsellor. He fell
upon his knees before the divine messenger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great Athene has sent me to you, king,&rdquo;
said the god, &ldquo;for she heard your prayer upon the
shore, and will deliver you from the forest danger.
Here is a sprig of the magic herb moly. Take it
in your hand for a safeguard against the wiles of
Circe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you go into the palace she will mix you
her enchanted potion, and strike you with her
wand. Do you draw your sword, and make as
though to slay her. Then she will fear greatly and
swear to do you no harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ulysses took the white flowered talisman, and
Hermes vanished among the trees.</p>

<p>Then he came swiftly upon the gleaming palace,
and going up to the marble porch struck upon it
with his sword hilt, and called to the goddess.</p>

<p>She glimmered towards him. Her hair was like
a young horse-chestnut fresh from the pod. Her
eyes were like pools of violet water, her neck was
a tower of ivory, and her lips were red as sunset.</p>

<p>The flower of evil, the goddess of strange sins!</p>

<p>She smiled at the hero, and led him by the hand
to a table on which was a golden cup, proffering it
to him in welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
Ulysses bowed low before her loveliness, and as
he drank there was a strange smile in his eyes.</p>

<p>The enchantress looked at him steadily. For a
single moment a ripple of doubt crossed her face,
but suddenly she seized her cedarn rod and smote
his side, crying, &ldquo;Get you to the stye, and lie there
in filth with your companions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ulysses drew his great sword, and held it over
her with menacing eyes. She drooped to him, a
very woman! and clung round him, weeping, and
he could feel her warm heart beating, beating close
to his. Her lovely hair fell around her in a golden
cloud, and tears streamed down her cheeks as she
swore by the gods on the Holy Hill never to harm
him.</p>

<p>And looking on her sinful loveliness the brain of
Ulysses burned for her, and he took her lithe body
in his strong arms and pressed the blossom of her
lips to his. Her arms stole round him, and she
called him lord and king.</p>

<p>Then with a soft smile she led him to the courtyard
where the swine lay sleeping in the sun.
When the foul beasts saw Ulysses they set up a
horrid chorus of grunting, and he raged to see his
valiant friends so degraded. But clinging to him,
the goddess raised her hand, and the swine vanished,
and the goodly mariners stood up among the straw,
more straight and tall than before, with all the
marks of hardship and travel smoothed from their
faces.</p>

<p>That night the other mariners came up from the
shore, guided by Ulysses. And the amber lamps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
flared in the hall, and all night till daybreak they
made a great feast. They sang in praise of love
and wine, and Circe sat at the right hand of the
King of Ithaca.</p>

<p>When the rosy dawn rushed up the sky, the
goddess rose.</p>

<p>The lamps paled in the fresh new light, and the
feast was over.</p>

<p>The mariners lay in sleep about the board, and
the purple wine was spilt about them.</p>

<p>Only the Goddess and the Hero were awake.</p>

<p>Then she said, &ldquo;Lord and love, the night is
over. The sun climbs the sky, the woodlands
awake. But let us go into my scented chamber,
my purple chamber where the day never comes.
There will we lie in love and sleep and forget the
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She led him by the hand over the cool marble
floor. The purple curtains fell behind them with a
soft noise of falling. All sound was hushed in the
courts of the palace, and the whole house was
still.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE THIRD EPISODE<br />
<br />
<span class="smltitle">How Ulysses walked in Hell, and of the
Adventure of the Sirens and Scylla</span></h2>


<p>The King of Ithaca stood all alone on a gloomy
barren shore, spear in hand. The sky lowered
black overhead, and from the vast yawning hole in
the terrible cliff which rose up before him he
seemed to hear strange wailings and faint cries
coming, so it seemed, from a great distance.</p>

<p>Had he at last broken away from the loving
arms of Circe for this horror? Stung once more
by the latent manhood in his blood, he had roused
his energies and left the enchanted island to set
out once more upon the weary quest for home.
He had bade the goddess farewell and sailed away
from the island of sweet lust to seek a ghostly
counsellor and to drink deep at that fountain of
wisdom which was once the glory of Thebes.</p>

<p>When Circe had bade him, if he would indeed
get back to Ithaca and leave her arms, seek the
dead Tiresias in the place of the dead it had
seemed an easy thing.</p>

<p>What were pale ghosts to a warrior of Troyland
and the vanquisher of Polyphemus? If the old seer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
alone could tell him how to conquer the wrath of
Poseidon and win to his wife&rsquo;s arms once more,
should he not go with a will?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;">
<a name="presence" id="presence"></a>

<p class="caption">THEN HE WAS, IN AN INSTANT MOMENT, AWARE OF A MORE
THAN MORTAL PRESENCE.</p>
<p class="refnote"><i>Page <a href="#Page_49">49</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>And he had set out with his crew, and the magic
wind which Circe gave them had brought them
hither over grey sad seas, while they had touched
nor oars nor helm.</p>

<p>And now Ulysses went slowly up to the fissure
in the rock, but a long solitary cry made him reel
back trembling as his brave heart had never done
before.</p>

<p>Then he was, in an instant moment, aware of a
more than mortal presence. Into that dread
place came the awful majesty of the Queen of
Heaven, and he fell to the ground before Athene.</p>

<p>The full flowing river of her speech came down
upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If thou wouldst hold thy wife once more,
Ulysses, and see thy rocky western home, then
must thou dare this peril. None can help thee
now save thou thyself. So it is decreed by the
gods. If so be it that thy courage fails thee now
then wilt thou be a wanderer for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady of Heaven,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I dare not go.
Oh, anything but that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Penelope!&rdquo; she murmured sweetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot face the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ithaca.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, listen to those wailings in the abyss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thy father Laertes weeps yet for the
wanderer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dead! The dead are waiting there!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
&ldquo;Men call thee Ulysses!&rdquo; said the goddess,
and at that word something moved within him
and his limbs began to stiffen, and once more the
hero felt the spear-shank hard and cold within his
grasp.</p>

<p>He raised his face, and there was once more the
old proud light upon it. Athene had gone, and
big with his new resolve he stepped towards the
blackness.</p>

<p>A voice came to him, thin, and far down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ulysses! Ulysses! son of Laertes, I wait to
guide thee. Hermes, son of Zeus, is with thee.
Take courage in both hands and come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king moved forward, and the dark swallowed
him up. He stumbled along a descending rock-strewn
pathway. In the increasing gloom it
seemed to him that he was on the side of a steep
hill. A moaning wind encircled him. Now and
again a slight gleam was visible from the golden
helmet of the god.</p>

<p>Far far down he saw the leaden livid river of
death, and on the sullen tide floated the stately
funeral barge of Charon, the ferryman of the dead.</p>

<p>The wind grew even more mournful and sad as
they trod the meadows of asphodel and the grey
lilies of the underworld towards the marge of
Styx.</p>

<p>Then the god called out aloud to the ferryman.
As his voice echoed over the water, the dusky night
became full of the sound of wings, and dark shapes
filled the air. The spirits of the dead flapped
round them in continual movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
The ghosts began to call and cry to the living
hero. Some had little squeaky voices like bats,
others made a louder and more hollow sound.</p>

<p>The howlings of the formless increased all round
Ulysses.</p>

<p>The inarticulate found utterance in the indefinite.</p>

<p>The waves of weird and hopeless voices rose,
fell, undulated, now loud and shrill, now sobbing
into silence. Little eager whispers filled the hero&rsquo;s
ear.</p>

<p>And to the terror of these great murmurs were
added the sight of superhuman outlines, which
melted away in the gloom almost as they appeared.
Alecto and Tisiphone, the Furies, circled round
Ulysses, and Megeara flew through the dark to
her sisters.</p>

<p>A cold hand seemed placed upon the hero&rsquo;s
soul. Cries from precipice to precipice, from air
to water, went on unceasingly&mdash;the melancholy
vociferations of the lost!</p>

<p>The loquacity of Hell!</p>

<p>And in deadly fear, but resolute still, Ulysses
struggled on through this great twilight world,
open on all sides. As he walked on, the flying
outlaws of the tomb seemed to be swarming over
him and pressing him to the ground. He struggled
beneath the weight of lost souls, but his whirling
arms struck nothing but the empty air.</p>

<p>Fresh clouds of spirits pricked the twilight,
increased in size, amalgamated, thickened, and
hurried towards him, crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
They came to the brink of the river. Before
them, as they looked out over the water, was no
horizon, but an opaque lividity like a wan, moving
precipice, a cliff of the night.</p>

<p>Then the old man Charon bowed to the commands
of the gods and embarked them on his
barge. He gazed on Ulysses with his keen wicked
eyes, and his long white beard wagged in hideous
mockery at this mortal among the dead.</p>

<p>The thin pole dipped in and out of the water,
and the drops which fell from it were the colour of
leaden bullets, for there is no life in the water of
Styx.</p>

<p>Ulysses knelt in the bottom of the boat and
shut out Hell from his eyes with his hand. He
prayed to Athene for help to endure, and that he
might have an answer from the old Seer Tiresias
that would lead him safely home at last.</p>

<p>And now the other bank of the river began to
loom up before them and the air began to be
silent.</p>

<p>On the bank, as it seemed to welcome them,
stood a tall old man with a golden sceptre in his
hand. His face was full of an unutterable sadness,
and his eyes were horny and dim with blindness.
But his magic staff conducted him safely to the
river brink, and in a high shivering voice he hailed
Ulysses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why hast thou come here, O wise one, leaving
the happy daylight for this cheerless shore?
Noble son of Laertes, I know thy quest, and thus
make answer. Father Zeus gave me power, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
still remains, and I, an old blind ghost, can see
into the future even on the shores of Styx. Thou
seekest to know if thou wilt ever catch thy wife
in thy strong arms once more, and tread the well-beloved
fields of Ithaca. The mighty god of the
sea, Poseidon, is wroth with thee and a malevolent
god. For even now his son Polyphemus stumbles
a bruised and sightless way among his native hills.
But yet you may return after long woes and heavy
toil. But one thing bear well in mind, O king,
else wilt thou suffer unbelievable things. When
thy ship touches at the Island Thrinacia, great
herds of cattle will be feeding there on the fresh
sweet grass which grows in the goodly upper
world. These be the beeves and steers of the
divine Helios, the Sun-God, and must be inviolate
to men. But if one sacred beast is slain, then thy
ship and all thy company will perish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perchance thou thyself may win Ithaca forlorn,
and to find others in thy place, but that I know
not. I have spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">THEY CAME TO THE BRINK OF THE RIVER.</p>
<p class="refnote"><i>Page <a href="#Page_52">52</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Then with a long melancholy cry the figure
vanished into the dark.</p>

<p>But in its place came a shadowy form which
made the heart of the hero leap and beat, so it
seemed all Hades was filled with the tumult.</p>

<p>His mother Anticlea stood before him.</p>

<p>Stretching out her cold, thin hands she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy that I suckled, why hast thou come
into Hades not yet being dead, for I see that the
flesh is still warm upon thee for which I drank
to Zeus?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mother of mine, I sought Tiresias the Theban
prophet. I have not even yet won Ithaca nor seen
the dear ones there. A god is against me. So I
came through the spirits of the unburied, and over
the dark river to seek counsel of the seer. Knowest
thou in this beyond-earth if the beloved Penelope
still holds me in her heart? or is she perhaps here
with thee, lost to the sunlight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother of Ulysses answered, &ldquo;Penelope is
as faithful and true as on thy wedding day, but
she is in a peril, so haste ye home. And now
farewell.&rdquo; Where Ulysses had seen his mother,
was but a little grey vapour which swayed and
vanished.</p>

<p>Then the hero called roughly to Charon, and
bade him take the pole and urge the barge back to
the starting-place. This time, though the multitude
of the dead circled over him with cries, begging
his help to take them out of Hades, he felt no
fear, for his mind was burning with other thoughts.</p>

<p>He mounted the long cliff side, and at last in
the distance saw a faint gleam of light stealing
down towards him. In the pale gleam the figure
of Hermes was manifest for a moment flitting up
to the day before him.</p>

<p>The cries grew fainter and more faint. The
light changed from grey to primrose, from primrose
to yellow. The little star which was the mouth of
the cave became a sun and then a world, and the
yellow turned into the white hot sunshine as Hell
faded utterly away.</p>

<p>On the beach the little blue waves sang on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
yellow sand. The black divers rose lazily on
the swell, and the shields round the prow of the
ship shone like white fire.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once more the vessel of heroes swam over the
seas. And now there was another quality in the
wind for them, and the world was a new world.</p>

<p>Their leader had told them that if they obeyed
his commands they would win home once more.
The news he had brought back from Hades made
them sturdy and strong of heart, and they vowed
that in all things they would trust in the king who
had dared the perils of the underworld.</p>

<p>Their thoughts turned with a lover&rsquo;s thirst to
images of their native land, tranquil skies, the old-remembered
meadows, cool brooks, and eternal
peace after their long wandering.</p>

<p>Hope beat high in the heart of Ulysses also.
The grey nightmare of Hell was over and in the
past, one more memory when in his own halls he
would weave his saga.</p>

<p>He had been near to the awful thing Death.</p>

<p>He had found that after all it was only Death.</p>

<p>The ship with a fair wind ran up a lane of light
into the setting sun, and when at length the moon
had risen and silvered all the sea, Ulysses called
the men round him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with the dawn, if I have
kept the reckoning aright, we shall come to the
island where the Sirens dwell. Now the Lady
Circe warned me against the Sirens, the singers
who charm all men with their song. He who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
listens to Parthenope, Ligeia and Leucosia must
stay with them for ever, listening spellbound to
the song until he dies. And the island is covered
with the bones of dead men. To listen is to die.
But I wish to hear the voices and to escape the
enchantment, and so obey my commands. When
we near the island do you all close your ears
with wax so that no sound can reach your brains.
And take a stout rope and bind me to the mast
so that I can in no wise loose myself. And howsoever
I may order or entreat you to let me go to
the Sirens, if their magic song enchants me, take
no heed, but row steadily onwards until the island
is far astern. Then only may you set me
free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As dawn came, a faint grey line upon the horizon
showed itself on the starboard bow. At the sight,
with some laughter, for it was difficult to believe
in the perils of sweet music!&mdash;even for men who
had seen the wonders that they had seen&mdash;the
men began to press yellow wax from the honeycomb
into each other&rsquo;s ears.</p>

<p>Then when no one among them could hear the
flapping of the sail or the voice of the sea, nor
could tell the meaning of his neighbour&rsquo;s voice,
they went up to Ulysses, and with many light-hearted
jests bound him to the mast, and because
his strength was well known to them they reeved
the rope with a treble hitch. No living man
could have escaped from such bonds.</p>

<p>As sailors will, they treated the whole thing as
a huge jest, making a mock mutiny of it as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
bound the captain. Ulysses could not help
smiling at their mirth.</p>

<p>After such wise precaution he had no fear, and
in his heart of hearts he did not believe that the
song of the Sirens would affect him much, though
he followed the advice of Circe and made himself
a prisoner.</p>

<p>But a fierce curiosity possessed him. He cursed
the slowness of the wind, for, as they bound him,
the island was still a low line without colour on
the water, and called out to the men to row faster,
forgetting that they could not hear him.</p>

<p>Slowly the grey island became purple, then
brown, and at last showed itself a green, low,
pleasant land, a place of meadows.</p>

<p>The wind was behind them, and until they came
quite close under the lee of the island Ulysses
could hear no voices but those of the wind and
waves. Then faintly at first, but rapidly becoming
more sonorous and sweet, he heard the magic
voices which were to ring in his ears in all his
after life.</p>

<p>No words of his at any time could express the
loveliness of those voices, of the unutterable
sweetness of it, nothing.</p>

<p>The strains floated over the still sea like harps
of heaven.</p>

<p>All that man had known or desired in life, all
the emotions which had stirred the human heart,
were blended in those magic voices. The world
had nothing more to give; here, here at last, was
the absolute fulfilment of beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
Louder and more piercingly sweet, as the unconscious
sailors bent to the oars in earnest, and
the sweat ran down their bare brown backs.</p>

<div class="cpoem28">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Whither away, whither away, whither away? Fly no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whither away from the high green field, and the happy blossoming shore?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day and night to the billow the fountain calls:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down shower the gambolling waterfalls<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From wandering over the lea.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The face of Ulysses grew wan and grey as the
ship passed a projecting point of rock. On the
smooth green turf the three singers were standing.
In face and form they were sweet and lovely girls.</p>

<p>Naked to the waist, they wore long flowing
draperies below, and as they sung the rosy bosoms
rose and fell with the music, and the lucid throats
rippled with song.</p>

<div class="cpoem24">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Mariner, mariner, furl your sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here are blissful downs and dales,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the rainbow lives in the curve of the sand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither, come hither and see.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And still the ship went on, but more slowly, as it
were some force were at work deadening the arms
of the rowers.</p>

<p>Then the shrill loveliness fired the hero&rsquo;s blood,
and he knew that he must go to the three lovely
singers on the strand. Earth held nothing better
than this&mdash;to lie for ever with that music in his
ears.</p>

These few lines of the Sirens&rsquo; song have been taken from
Lord Tennyson&rsquo;s beautiful poem &ldquo;The Sea Fairies.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Then, as if drawn by the long cadenced notes as
by cords, Ulysses gathered up his mighty strength
and strove with his bonds.</p>

<p>But the sailors had done their work too well, and
the rope only cut deeply into the flesh.</p>

<p>The white arms were stretched out to him in
supplication, the song grew more full of unearthly
beauty than before&mdash;and the ship was slowly passing
by.</p>

<p>Ulysses called out to the crew in an agony of
command and entreaty.</p>

<p>One of the men happened to look up and saw
his face. He grinned, nudged his companion,
and turned away.</p>

<p>The song grew fainter, the three tall figures
dwindled. The face of Ulysses grew ashen, and
when at length they came to him and cut the ropes
he said no word.</p>

<p>He went alone to the prow of the vessel and
looked out over the fair sun-bathed sea, and there
were tears in his eyes, and his mouth was softer
and more tremulous than it was wont to be.</p>

<p>So they came away from Parthenope, Ligeia
and Leucosia, the Sirens.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next day Ulysses called the crew together
as before and told them of the new peril that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
awaited them. For the wise Circe had warned
him that after the island of the Sirens he must
needs encounter the terrible Scylla, for the ship
must pass by her lair on its passage towards
Home.</p>

<p>But Ulysses knew that it was impossible to fight
the monster, and that some of the crew were fated
to die, but in his wisdom he did not tell them that.</p>

<p>He finished his speech as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;And so,
my friends, the gods ordain that we must face
Scylla, and the whirlpool Charybdis. There is no
other way. But courage! always have courage.
I who brought you safe from out of the cave of
the Cyclops will bring you safe from this also.
And so onward and have stout hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a misty day, and everything was shadowy
and faint, but the ship moved slowly along a sheer
wall of black cliff which towered up above them
for a thousand feet or more. The top was lost in
the mist. It was a lowering, frightful place.</p>

<p>One of the sailors gave a shout which echoed
back to them in mournful mockery through the
mist.</p>

<p>They rowed on steadily, hugging the cliff.
Ulysses stood in the prow of the boat. He had
put on armour and took two spears in his hand.</p>

<p>His eyes searched the face of the cliff till they
ached from the minute scrutiny.</p>

<p>This waiting for the inevitable was terribly
unnerving. Ulysses himself, knowing that some
must die, was heavy and sad at heart as they
glided along the side of the cliff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
To the left the great whirlpool seethed and
boiled, its outermost convolution scarce a bow-shot
away. When it threw up the water the spray
dashed up a hundred feet and fell in showers over
the sailors, and as the water ran back in the ebb
Ulysses could see, far down the black and spinning
sides, to where the old witch Charybdis dwelt on
the dark sand of the sea bottom.</p>

<p>Suddenly the end came. A loud barking and
howling startled them all so that each man paused
on his oar. A pack of hounds were unkenneled,
so it seemed, somewhere on the cliff face in the
mist.</p>

<p>Then a sickly musky smell enveloped them, so
foul and stale that they coughed and spat even
as their blood ran cold with fear.</p>

<p>Through the curtain of mist, which had suddenly
grown very thick, six objects loomed right over
the boat.</p>

<p>Six long tentacles swayed and quivered over the
sailors, and at the end of each was a grinning head
set with cruel fangs and a little red eager tongue
that flickered in and out.</p>

<p>For a moment the heads hung poised, and then
each sought and found its victim.</p>

<p>Six sailors were slowly drawn out of the boat,
shrieking the name of Ulysses for the last time in
their death agony. And all the time the barking
of the hounds in the obscene womb of the monster
went on unceasingly.</p>

<p>Then the fury of flight came upon them. With
bursting brains and red fire before their eyes they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
laboured at the great oars until the wood bent and
shook and the ship leaped forward like a driven
horse.</p>

<p>And they left the strait of death and came out
of the mist into a wide sunlit sea. But still a
sound of distant barking came down the wind.</p>

<p>So Scylla took her horrid toll of heroes.</p>

<p>But Ulysses called them to prayer and lamentation
for the dead.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE FOURTH EPISODE<br />
<br />
<span class="smltitle">How Ulysses lost his Merry Men and came
A Waif to Calypso with the Shining
Hair</span></h2>


<p>The crew sat round a fire of driftwood.</p>

<p>There was shelter where they sat, in a natural
alcove of rock, but outside the great winds
thundered and the wrack flew before the storm
and a mighty unceasing roar filled the air.</p>

<p>The faces of all the sailors wore a sullen look.
Hunger had begun to suck the colour from their
cheeks, their eyes were prominent and strained,
their movements without energy or vigour.</p>

<p>A rude shelter of sailcloth and various <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
that was scattered about seemed to show that
for some time, at least, they had made their home
in this place where the winds did not come.</p>

<p>Ulysses was not among them. They were
talking in low, discontented tones among themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A whole month,&rdquo; said Eurylochus, &ldquo;a whole
month have we been sea bound in this accursed
island. I am sick of islands!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
&ldquo;Never have we put to shore without some
evil thing befalling,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Oh, for
Ithaca!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt we shall ever see Ithaca again,&rdquo; said
a third. &ldquo;We will be wanderers till we die; that is
what I think. And this place is like to be the
grave of all of us. I never knew a wind so
furious to blow so long. We should sink in an
hour did we but put out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only food for one day more, and that
sparse,&rdquo; said Eurylochus. &ldquo;For my part, my limbs
are heavy as brass and the strength is all gone
from me. I could not move an oar now. Man
needs meat and wine or the fires of hunger burn
the sinews and dry the blood. Brown meat and
red wine! I could fill my belly till the skin
cracked!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rich brown meat, mate! Dost mind the
soft kids on Circe&rsquo;s island? By Zeus, I can taste
them now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay and the fat cows, roast till the blood ran
out of them like liquid life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can even smell the smell of the roasting meat
now. A welcome smell to a hungry man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would that we had never left Circe. &rsquo;Twas a
kind queen, meet for our master! but her girls
were kindly in love also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Hades with the girls!&rdquo; said Eurylochus.
&ldquo;Thy talk of meat makes me heave with desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked round cautiously before he continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; he said in a low, rapid whisper, &ldquo;tell
me, are ye purposing to starve in the midst of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
plenty? Saw ye ever such fat oxen and cows as
graze in the pastures above?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never did I see such cattle,&rdquo; answered another
hungry wight. &ldquo;Gods! they would make a feast
for kings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet pain and sickness is all over us, and
we lust for food till we know not what we do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain&rsquo;s orders!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ulysses has lost his cunning for sure, and
hunger has turned his brain. He is no more the
brave leader of old. He goes wandering alone
among the rocks and sleeps all day. And his eye
is clouded and courage has left his voice. Friends,
shall we die thus? No man of ye loveth Ulysses
better than I love him. Is he not my kinsman
indeed? He brought us from the Cyclops&rsquo; cave
and dared the perils of Hell. All this I know and
say before you now. But the king is distraught
and moody. He does not know what he is doing.
He would be the first to join us with the merry
and grateful word were he to come back and find
the good red beef roasting on the fire and smell
the savoury smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, captain was never one set against a feast!
He loves good cheer, as becomes a proper fighting
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mind doubts me, comrades,&rdquo; said another.
&ldquo;Should we not rather trust the king even unto
this last thing? Have we ever found him wanting
yet? Did he not make us promise? Zeus knows
if the thought of hot meat does not tickle my
belly as well as thine&mdash;more, friend, for thou hast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
a paunch yet and none have I&mdash;but I for one trust
in the captain. He knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Eurylochus took up his spear as if he had
decided and the discussion was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In all shapes death is
a terrible thing. But I would rather die quickly
at Scylla&rsquo;s hands than fade into Hades through
famine. Hunger is the worst death of all. Come
with me and bring your spears. We will choose
the best of the herd and sacrifice to the gods.
When we reach home again, can we not build a
great temple to Helios, and fill it with rich gifts?
The Sun-God, who gives light to all the world,
will not grudge us a cow or two. Not he. &rsquo;Tis a
more genial god than that. Ay, and though we
indeed anger the god and he wreck us in the
deep! I put ye this question&mdash;Would ye not
rather swallow the cold salt water for a moment
and so die, than die for days among the rocks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His pale face worked with the force of his words.
His eyes glistened with a terrible eagerness. As
he spoke in a high, quivering nervous tenor,
shaking his spear at them, the eagerness crept into
their eyes also.</p>

<p>Famine strangely transforms the human face.
They became men with brute&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Eurylochus marched away out of the shelter
towards the pasture lands, and the others followed
him. New strength seemed to come to them as
they walked towards the herd, which could be
seen, a red brown mass, grazing on a plain some
half-mile away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
The full force of the wind struck and retarded
them as they emerged into the open, but it brought
the lowing of the cattle to their ears and they
pressed on.</p>

<p>Ulysses lay sleeping about a quarter of a mile
from the cove.</p>

<p>He had wandered away from his companions in
great despondency. For four long weeks the gale
had roared past the island away to the north.
The rain had fallen like spears, the thunder
stammered its awful message, the green and white
lightning snapped like whips of light. In all this
the king saw the finger of evil. He knew that
the mighty Poseidon still watched his fortunes
with cruel, angry eyes. For this storm was no
chance warring of the elements, but came, he knew,
directed against him and his fated crew.</p>

<p>Food had got lower and lower, the men began
to grumble, and black looks of reproach met his
eyes on every side.</p>

<p>And all the time the fat cattle of Apollo cropped
the tender shoots of the grass, the full udder
dropped with creamy milk, and the shining flanks
of the great beasts sent an alluring message to the
starving men.</p>

<p>Often Ulysses withdrew into some lonely place
and prayed to Athene, but she seemed asleep or
weary of his woes, for there came no answering
sign.</p>

<p>On this day hope seemed to have utterly departed
from him. There was no break in the
leaden clouds of the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
He had wandered away along the seashore, and
fallen asleep from languor and grief, lulled by the
great singing of the gale overhead.</p>

<p>In his sleep he dreamed vividly. He saw the
interior of the island. Suddenly, from among a
clump of trees, a bright beam of golden light shot
up heavenwards. He knew that one of the shepherd
nymphs of Apollo went with some message
for the god, and he shivered and moaned in his
slumber.</p>

<p>Then it seemed that he was in a great place of
cloud, an immense formless world of mist. And
through the mist came a terrible voice which
turned him to stone. It was the voice of Apollo
crying in anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father Zeus, and all ye gods who dwell
upon the hill above the thunder! punish the
comrades of Ulysses for their crime. They have
speared my beautiful cows that were my joy and
of which I had great pleasure. Whenever I
turned my face and shone upon the world I
watched them feeding in my island. And now
these whelps have slain the finest of all my herd.
Vengeance! Bitter vengeance, or will I go far
down into Hell and leave the world in gloom and
shine no more upon it. I will make Hades a place
of warmth and laughter, and the world all grey
and full of death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the midst Ulysses awoke with that angry cry
still ringing in his ears. With a sick apprehension
he hurried along the slippery boulders to the
shelter place where he had left the crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
Within a hundred yards of the place he knew
the worst. The wind blew a savoury smoke
towards him, and his stomach yearned while his
brain trembled in fear.</p>

<p>The men were in high glee when he came round
the corner of rock among them, great joints turned
upon rough spits, skins and horns encumbered the
ground, and the rich fat dropped hissing into the
fire.</p>

<p>A sudden silence fell upon their merriment as
the captain came. He spread out his hands with
a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; he said sorrowfully, &ldquo;ye have
chosen to do this thing against my advice, and
now it is done we must abide by the deed. I
cannot reproach you. Still, I know that we must
pay heavily for this sin against the Sun-God.
Farewell, Ithaca! And now it is over let us
eat of our unhallowed spoil. It may be that
this is our last meal together, comrades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he had finished speaking a strange and
ominous thing happened. The blood-stained
skins began to creep about like live things
upon the ground.</p>

<p>The red meat over the fire withered and moaned
as if in pain. The air was filled with a lowing as
of cows.</p>

<p>Then in mad fear and riotous despair they fell
upon the horrid meal with eager, tremulous hands.
Ulysses was taken with the madness like the
rest, and until sundown they gorged the dripping
meat till they could eat no more, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
their faces were bloated and their eyes were
strained.</p>

<p>As the sun sank into the sea with a red and
angry face the wind dropped and ceased. A great
calm spread over the waters. When the moon rose
the ocean was like a sheet of still silver.</p>

<p>Very hurriedly, whispering among themselves,
as though they were afraid of their own voices,
they launched the ship and rowed out into the
moonlight, racing away from the accursed isle.</p>

<p>And now the last scene of all came very
quickly.</p>

<p>Ulysses was wont to say that of all the things
he had witnessed in his life this was the saddest
and most terrible.</p>

<p>A sudden crackle of thunder pealed over the
sky. A fantastic network of lightning played
round the ship like lace.</p>

<p>A dark cloud formed itself directly over the
boat, not two mast&rsquo;s lengths above, and all the
waves below became like ink in the shadow. For
a time it hung there motionless, and then suddenly
a mighty wind swooped down on them like a hawk
drops out of the sky. The mast snapped like a
pipe-stem and crashed upon the deck, braining the
helmsman in its fall. A smooth green wave, just
slightly bubbling with froth on the crest, but like
a hill of oil, rose and swept over the ship.</p>

<p>Ulysses clung to a stanchion with all his mighty
strength, and was just able to battle against the
flood. When it passed over him he saw that
every man of the crew was in the water. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
a few moments they floated round him with sad
cries of farewell, and then one by one they were
swept into the Ultimate.</p>

<p>The timbers of the ship broke away and she fell
to pieces. With a loud cry to Athene, Ulysses
launched himself on the waves clinging to a great
log which had formed part of the keel. A swift
current urged him along far away from the scene
of the wreck.</p>

<p>The purpose of the god was accomplished, and
the waves fell, and the moonlight shone out clear
and still once more.</p>

<p>On all the waste of waters no sail, no cape nor
headland broke the silver monotone.</p>

<p>Loneliness descended upon the hero like a cloak;
an utter abandonment such as he had never known
before in life.</p>

<p>The water began to grow very cold.</p>

<p>An awful silence lay over the sea. The terrible
jubilant silence of a god revenged!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so all those well-known, long-tried voices
were still! Never again would Eurylochus drain
the full tankard in a kindly health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ulysses bowed his head, and bitter tears welled
up into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never again would grey old Diphilos stand at
the helm of the good ship, sending his keen eyes
out over the sounding wastes. How the last
mournful cry of Jamenos had echoed through
the storm. Young, straight Jamenos who had
approached the Cyclops with him, beautiful young
Jamenos, with the bold eyes and curling hair!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
And there was old Perdix too, old Perdix
with his grin and chuckle and his tales. Never
would Perdix sit by the fire and make merry
yarns any more. The little twinkling rat-like
eyes were stark and glazed now. Perdix stood
beside the livid river among the rushing spirits.
He would have no jests now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw them all together, in peril, storm, and
quiet weather. His trusty men! His dear
comrades!</p>

<p>And now he alone was left, alone, alone,
alone.</p>

<p>Perhaps Athene herself was still with him and
had not even yet forgotten her wanderer. As
the thought struck along his brain a faint blush
of hope began to flush his pallid cheek.</p>

<p>He floated on and on. Dawn came, waxed
strong, waned. Tremulous evening came like a
shy novice about to take the veil of night.
Night blazed in moonlit splendour once
more.</p>

<p>And at the hour when night stands still and
dawn is not yet, the waves, kindlier than before,
carried him to the island of Ogygia, where he
heard the sea nymphs on the shore singing him a
fairy welcome.</p>

<p>Soft hands drew him from the deep, soft voices
welcomed him; it seemed as if one queenly presence,
a tall woman with golden hair which shone,
towered among the rest, and he fell into a gentle
swoon, a soft surrender to sleep.</p>

<p>Soft and low the sea-maidens sang while
Ulysses lay sleeping&mdash;even as they had sung
nine long years ago when the sea cast him up
on the shores of Calypso&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>

<p>It was bright sunlight, a great fire of cedar
wood burnt on an altar before the cave of the
goddess who loved the hero, and the smoke
scented all the island.</p>

<p>Among the grove of stately trees which
bordered the smooth pneumatic lawn in front of
the cave Ulysses lay sleeping on a bed of fresh-born
violets. A purple mantle shot with gold,
woven by Calypso, was spread over him.</p>

<p>The poplars and fragrant cypresses were full of
sweet-voiced birds.</p>

<p>Over the mouth of the cave grew a great vine,
and the black grapes drooped and fell from it in
their abundance.</p>

<p>From the centre of the short emerald grass four
springs of clear water came up in thin whips and
flowed away in flashing rivulets.</p>

<p>This was the home and kingdom of the Goddess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
Calypso, and was so beautiful a place that the
fame of it had even reached Olympus, and the
gods knew of the island.</p>

<p>And nine long years had passed! It was nine
years ago that the pale gaunt waif of the sea&mdash;a
sad jetsam!&mdash;had swooned upon the yellow sand,
while the bright-haired lady of Ogygia had gazed
in wonder upon him.</p>

<p>Circe had enthralled Ulysses for a year in her
palace of wine and sorcery and lust. That was
a time of fierce sinful pleasures, of wild deliriums.</p>

<p>The fire had blazed, burnt, and died away in that
still marble house in the wood.</p>

<p>But how different these nine dreamy years!
The mild-eyed, loving goddess lay in the hero&rsquo;s
arms each night in tender love and sleep. She
was no Circe, but a lady of quieter delights. Her
spell was upon him, he was chained to her kind
side by a magic influence, but she loved him, and
was no Circe.</p>

<p>Nine long years!</p>

<p>Those old valiant mariners from the plains of
Troyland were only white bones now, part of the
sea-bed. They were far-off, remote, sweet sad
memories.</p>

<p>Calypso was the slow and gracious music to
which his life moved now. Often he doubted all
the past. They were phantoms all those old half-forgotten
people.</p>

<p>So he lay sleeping among the violets. The
scented wind gave a myriad whispers to the
poplars. The four springs sang a thin jocund
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
song as they burst from the dark rich earth into
the sunshine, and within her cave the goddess
threw the golden shuttle and made a low crooning
music as she thought of her stately warrior
hard by, and sent him dreams of her white neck
and wealth of golden hair.</p>

<p>She knew he would never leave her now. Her
spells were too strong. Her love too great.</p>

<p>During the first years he had been wont to
wander away to a lonely part of the shore. He
would sit gazing with haunted eyes out over the
sea, and his thoughts went to Penelope, and he
shed a tear for old King Laertes and whispered
to little Telemachus.</p>

<p>But that also was over for him now. Ithaca was
but a misty cloud, and the dear ones there but
dreams in this island of dreams.</p>

<p>The face of Ulysses was changed. The hard
lines of endeavour, the brown painting of the
wind, had gone from it. Noble and beautiful still,
but even in sleep it could be seen to have lost its
force.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the dim recesses of the grove, there
was a silence. The birds stopped singing, and the
murmur of the insects droned, swelled louder, and
died away.</p>

<p>Nothing was heard for a moment but the trickle
of the streams, and then this also faded from sound.</p>

<p>By the side of the sleeping hero stood the tall
white figure of Athene. At her feet yellow flowers
broke out like little flames, and her deep, grave
eyes were bent full upon Ulysses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
Perhaps he felt that unearthly majesty above
him, for he turned and moaned in his sleep.</p>

<p>The goddess, like a statue of white marble,
stood looking down at him for several moments.
Then with a little sigh she stooped and touched
his forehead with her long slender fingers.</p>

<p>The birds began a full-throated ecstasy of song,
which filled the wood with a sound as of a myriad
tiny flutes. The furry bees went swinging through
the sunlit grove with deep organ music, the shrill
tinkle of the streams sent its cool message once
more into the hot swooning air.</p>

<p>Where the goddess had stood there was nothing
but a clump of yellow crocus and some violets
more vivid than the rest.</p>

<p>Ulysses awoke with sudden stammerings like a
frightened child. He looked round him with
strange troubled eyes.</p>

<p>Then slowly he rose up and walked through the
wood towards the cave of Calypso.</p>

<p>Forgotten fingers were upon the latch of his
brain, old scenes began to move through it in
swift familiar panorama, he was as a man who
wakened from a sleep of years.</p>

<p>One word burst from his lips&mdash;&ldquo;Penelope!&rdquo; His
face cleared as though a mist had suddenly dispersed
before it, and his walk quickened into a
firm, long stride as he came out on to the
lawn.</p>

<p>He stopped short as he saw the mouth of the
cave. Calypso was pacing up and down with her
sinuous graceful step, and at her side walked a tall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
young man with a golden wand in his hand and
winged sandals upon his feet.</p>

<p>And Ulysses knew him for the God Hermes who
had given him the sacred herb in Circe&rsquo;s island and
who had led him down the gloomy ways of Hades.</p>

<p>They turned and came towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will never wish to go, Hermes,&rdquo; he heard
Calypso say as they drew near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;King,&rdquo; said the god, &ldquo;I am come to you with
a message from Father Zeus. He hath seen you
lying in this island with the goddess, and bids
me tell you of Ithaca and home once more, that
your heart may beat strong within you and you
may adventure forth and find your wife Penelope
in your ancestral house. And the father promises
you divine protection. Your long wanderings
shall be at an end, and you shall come safely
to the land of your heart&rsquo;s desire. Is it your will
to go and leave the lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The goddess laughed a little musical laugh of
certain triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Ah, he will not go, Hermes.
Could he not have left me any time these nine
long years of love? Go! No, my mariner loves
too well the soft couches of Ogygia, and these
weak arms can yet hold his wisdom captive.
How will you answer, my heart&rsquo;s love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Ithaca?&rdquo; said Ulysses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to Penelope thy wife, who sorroweth for
thee and is in peril,&rdquo; answered the god.</p>

<p>A bright light flashed into Ulysses&rsquo; eyes and
his cheek was flushed with hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now have I tarried too long in this place,&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;I know not why, but never before has
my heart burned within me as now. Yes, to
Ithaca! back to my father and my wife and the
old hills of home! Zeus be praised, for I who was
asleep waken this day, and manhood is mine once
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Calypso drooped her lovely head like a
tired flower as the God Hermes flashed up into
the sky like a beam of light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see something of which I know not has
come over you, lord of my heart,&rdquo; she said sadly.
&ldquo;I have no more power, save only the power of
my deep love for you which you have forgotten.
Who am I that I can combat the will of Zeus or
the hardness of your heart? I have loved you
well and cherished you, and shall I love you less
now? No, I am no cruel goddess. Go, and my
heart be with you; and what power is mine to
aid you that shall you have. I doubt,&rdquo; she said,
with a sudden burst of anger, &ldquo;I doubt you have
some greater goddess than I at your side, some
lovelier lady, else how could my spell be broken?
But now come within and make a farewell feast with
me. My heart is sick and I would die. But one
thing I can give you if you will not go. Would
you be immortal? Stay with your lover and
that gift is yours. Never shall death touch you
or age. I am a goddess and can never die. Am
I less beautiful than Penelope, or less kind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ulysses answered her pleadings slowly and
painfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
&ldquo;My queen and goddess, I know indeed that
Penelope can never compare with such immortal
loveliness as yours. Yes, she will grow old and
wrinkled, and must die. Yet night and day all
my heart must go out to her, and I would endure
a thousand storms and sorrows to see home once
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of my great love for you, go, and
may all the gods shower blessings on you and
protect you,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, and her
eyes were all blind with tears.</p>

<hr />

<p>On a red evening Calypso stood alone on a
rock that jutted out into the sea.</p>

<p>A black speck against the setting sun showed
clear and far away.</p>

<p>Then the night fell, and she wandered weeping
through her scented avenues.</p>

<p>But her heart was away on the moaning sea,
away with Ulysses the departed.</p>

<h2>THE LAST EPISODE<br />
<br />
<span class="smltitle">How the King came Home again after
the Long Years</span></h2>


<p>With the tears blinding his eyes, with shaking
hands, speechless with the happy thoughts surging
in his brain, Ulysses knelt and kissed the
dear, dear shores of his own country.</p>

<p>The same rocky coasts, the same great mountain
in the centre of the island raising its head into
the clouds, everywhere eternally the same, and how
beloved! was it not all mist and dreams&mdash;the long
past? How he heard the Sirens sing, seen the
swaying arms of the foul Scylla, and dwelt in love
and slumber with Calypso?</p>

<p>And by his side once more stood the goddess,
serene and beautiful in her benevolent but awful
calm. From her lips he had heard that here, even
here in his own land, in the fields of his inheritance,
one more supreme effort awaited him.
He had learnt how his palace was full of riotous
princes, who wooed his wife, the Queen Penelope.
He knew how his son, the goodly Prince Telemachus,
was least in his own house, and how wild
revel and wantonness ate up his substance. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
queen in peril! Penelope all but given up to the
desires of lust and greed. All his great heart
burnt with anger and hate against the suitors, and
yet, with a strange dual emotion, beat high with
pride for his dear and stainless lady, who still
mourned for her husband, and longed against
hope for his return.</p>

<p>He kissed the kindly home-ground, and at that
sacred contact a sense of strength and power came
to him, a god-like power, that in all his long toils
and wanderings he had never known before.</p>

<p>He became conscious that Athene was speaking
to him. &ldquo;And remember ever, my Ulysses, that
now thou hast need of all thy wit and cunning.
In all the chances of thy life before never hadst
thou need to walk as warily as now. For mere
strength and valour unallied to wisdom and cunning
will avail one nothing against the hundred.
But at the hour of need I will be once more with
thee if thou doest well and wisely. Courage!
son of Laertes! &rsquo;tis but a little while till the
end. Let not thy love and hate master thee until
the appointed hour. And now, that thou mayest
walk in thy palace and groves unknown for who
thou art, I give thee a disguise. And so farewell
until the hour of triumph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stretched out her spear over the kneeling
king. The firm flesh dried and wrinkled upon
his arms and legs. His hair shrivelled up into
grey sparseness and his eyes dimmed. He wore
a tattered cloak, a thing of shreds and patches,
and an old beggar&rsquo;s staff of ilex was in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
But beneath this seeming age and weakness
was hidden the true hero as strong and cunning
as before.</p>

<p>The goddess turned into light and was no more,
and with slow, tottering footsteps Ulysses took
a lonely way among the well-remembered paths
of his native hills.</p>

<p>After an hour&rsquo;s travelling he came out on a
smooth pasture land, with a little homestead
nestling among a clump of trees. His heart
beat eagerly within him, for if perchance after
these long years farmer Eum&aelig;us still lived,
here he might gain news of his palace and
perhaps a friend.</p>

<p>Eum&aelig;us was once the steward of the estates
and a very faithful servant of his master. Ulysses
approached the house. In front was a large courtyard,
made by a fence of oak and hawthorn
boughs, and within were twelve great pens for
swine.</p>

<p>And in the porch sat old Eum&aelig;us himself
making himself a pair of sandals, hardly changed
in a single feature, though perhaps his eyes were
not so bright as in the old times.</p>

<p>Hearing footsteps, the four fierce dogs which
herded the swine rushed out of the yard and leapt
angrily at the newcomer. He might have fared
badly, for the great beasts were lean and evil-tempered,
had not the swineherd ran out to his
help and drew them off with curses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="friend" id="friend"></a>
<img src="images/utw07.jpg" width="600" height="416"
alt="Eumaeus and Ulysses talk" />
<p class="captionpad">&ldquo;NAY, IF YOU LOVE ME,&rdquo; HE SAID, &ldquo;NONE OF THAT, MY FRIEND.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>He turned to Ulysses. &ldquo;Thank the gods, old
fellow,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that I was near by. A little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
more and you would have been torn to pieces,
and then you would be in an evil plight but I a
worse! Dead would you be and past caring, but
I should be disgraced. Heaven knows, I have
enough trouble to bear. Here&rsquo;s my lawful master
gone in foreign parts these long years&mdash;dead as
like as not&mdash;and I sit here feeding swine for them
that are but little better themselves. But come
in, come in, old shrew. There&rsquo;s a bite of food
for you within, which you need I make no doubt,
and then you can tell me your story, for I am a
lonely man now and like a crack of talk as well
as most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The garrulous old fellow pushed him in with
busy geniality and sat him down on the goatskin,
which was his bed. Then he fetched what meat
and wine he could furnish, and they sat down to
a frugal meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, then, about this lord of yours?&rdquo; said
Ulysses. &ldquo;I myself have wandered far these
last years. Perhaps I may have met with him,
and can give you news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The swineherd chuckled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, if you love me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;none of that,
my friend. Why, every dirty old man as comes
along this way has some such tale to tell. And
then my poor lady up in the palace&mdash;the gods
save her!&mdash;she takes them in and gives them a new
cloak or what not, and believes all they say until
the next one comes along. No! my dear lord
is dead and never shall I look upon the like of him
again. By Zeus! but he was a man if you like!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, my host, we shall see in the future,&rdquo; said
Ulysses, in so significant a tone that the swineherd
was startled for a moment.</p>

<p>The wind had arisen and it was a black stormy
night so they went to rest early, and Eum&aelig;us
slept soundly till dawn. But all through the
silent hours the brain of Ulysses worked like a
shuttle in a loom.</p>

<p>At breakfast-time, while the swineherd was
preparing the meal, the dogs began to bark loudly
outside, but in a welcome manner, saluting one
whom they knew.</p>

<p>Footsteps were heard crossing the yard, and a
tall young man with the first down of manhood on
his lip stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>Eum&aelig;us dropped the bowls in which he had
been mixing the wine with a sudden clatter and
ran towards the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My young lord,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;oh, my young lord,
the sight of you is a welcome one to weary eyes.
Come within my poor place. This is but a poor
old man who shelters with me for a day or two.
Don&rsquo;t mind him, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Telemachus the son of Ulysses.</p>

<p>The king rose humbly and offered his seat to
his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your place, old man,&rdquo; said the prince.
&ldquo;The swineherd will find me another. And
who may you be, and what do you in Ithaca?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses told him a long story. He said
that he was a Cretan, and had fought at Troy and
was now destitute and a wanderer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
&ldquo;Could you not take him to the palace, my
lord?&rdquo; said Eum&aelig;us. &ldquo;Perhaps he might find
some work there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will clothe him, and arm him with a sword,
and give him a little to help him on his way,&rdquo; said
Telemachus, &ldquo;and that most gladly. But I
cannot take him to the palace. The suitors would
ill-use him because of his age, perhaps they would
kill him for sport. I cannot restrain them; I am
young; and what is one against so many? Moreover,
so great is the hate they bear towards me,
they would surely slay any guest of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses rose from his seat and bowed.
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I may dare to speak and you
will hear, I say foul wrong is wrought against
you in your palace, and my blood rages when I
think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old fellow, you are right enough,&rdquo; said the boy,
sadly. &ldquo;Oh, for my dead sire! to sweep these
dogs from Ithaca!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the king!&rdquo; said Eum&aelig;us, with a deep
sigh.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ulysses saw the tall figure of Athene
was standing by his side.</p>

<p>The other two were looking towards him, but
could see nothing of her presence. The goddess
looked at him with kindly eyes and touched him
with her spear.</p>

<p>Telemachus and Eum&aelig;us crouched trembling
and speechless against the furthest side of the hut.</p>

<p>The bronze came back to the face of the king,
his hair fell from his head in all its old luxuriance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
his figure filled out, and he stood before them in
his full stature and all the glory of his manhood.</p>

<p>Eum&aelig;us fell upon his knees and covered his
eyes with his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A god! a god!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;a god has come
to us! Hail, oh Immortal One, guest of my
poor homestead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Telemachus knelt also. &ldquo;Oh, Divine stranger,
a boon! Tell me of my dear father, if indeed
he lives and knows of the peril of his house.
And will he ever come back to sit in his own
chair and rule?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Ulysses stepped to his son and caught
him in his arms and kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Telemachus! Telemachus!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no god
am I, but your own dear father come home at
last, and I am come with doom and death for
the insolent ones about my board!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when they had all three mingled their
happy tears, Telemachus said, &ldquo;Father, I know
how great a warrior you are, and all the world
rings with the wisdom and valour of your deeds.
But we two can never fight against so many.
In all, the princes number a hundred and a score
of men; and they are all trained fighting men,
the best from Ithaca and all the neighbouring
islands. We must have other aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comfort yourself, son,&rdquo; said Ulysses. &ldquo;Aid
we have, and the mightiest of all. Athene herself
watches over my fortunes and will come in
the hour of need. She has brought me hither
and given me this disguise, and in all the coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
contest her voice will help and her arm be for
us. Should we need more aid than that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, my father,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;we are well
favoured, and my heart leaps within me at what
is to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, once more the manhood
of Ulysses left him and only a poor old
beggar man stood before the swineherd and the
prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now will we go to the palace,&rdquo; said Ulysses.
&ldquo;I shall seem but a poor old beggar man, and
however the princes may ill-use me I shall do
nothing till the time has come and we are ready,
and I charge you, my son, and my good friend
Eum&aelig;us, that you do nothing to protect me
however I am treated. You may check them
by words if you can, but no more. And not
even the queen herself must know that the
king has come home again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now let us go. The judge is set, the
doom begun; none shall stay it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the three went out from the hut over
the mountain paths towards the palace.</p>

<hr />

<p>The revel was at its height in the courtyard
of the palace. Stone seats ran round the wall
which enclosed the buildings. Over a low colonnade
the orchard trees drooped into the court,
and a huge vine trailed its weight of fruit over
the marble.</p>

<p>The hot afternoon sun sent a vivid colour
over everything. Beyond the palace the blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
mountains towered into a sky of deeper blue.
Purple shadows from the buildings lay upon the
white marble, and the long light glittered on a
great table piled with golden cups and bowls,
holding the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the feast.</p>

<p>A wild uproar and shouting filled the air.</p>

<p>The court was filled with whirling figures of
men and girls half drunk with wine and excitement
as they moved in the figures of a lascivious
dance.</p>

<p>All the household girls were there with the
suitors joining in the feast, and peals of laughter
shivered through the sunny air.</p>

<p>Telemachus sat on a seat apart watching the
revel with keen eyes. There was a repressed excitement
in his face and an eager regard. One of
the girls noticed it as she strolled past. She was
a slight, fair wanton creature with a mocking
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, Lord Telemachus?&rdquo; she said, laughing
lightly, &ldquo;are you not going to join us in the fun?
You make a sorry host indeed! Is not this your
palace, and do you leave us without your countenance.
Oh, shame upon you for a laggard youth
when wine and kisses wait you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made an impudent grimace at him and
flitted past. But a short time back he would have
raged at this impudent salutation from a pretty
slave girl who drew a confident strength from the
protection of his enemies. But now he hardly
heard her, but leant forward again in the attitude
of one who watches and waits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
Outside the palace gate, on the hot white road,
two old men were approaching. One was the
swineherd Eum&aelig;us and the other a wandering
beggar man.</p>

<p>Just by the threshold of the courtyard an old
lean dog, very grey and feeble, lay upon a heap of
dung in the sunlight. The mailed horse-flies
hovered round him in swarms, but he seemed too
weak to drive them away. As the beggar
approached he threw his muzzle up into the air
with a quick movement. His sightless eyes turned
towards the advancing footsteps. With a great
effort he scrambled to his feet. The lean tail
wagged in tremulous joy, the scarred ears were
pricked in welcome.</p>

<p>He stumbled to the feet of Ulysses. When he
touched him the old dog lay down in the dust and
with a long sigh he died.</p>

<p>And this was the first welcome the king had
to his palace, and as he went in through the gates
his eyes were wet with tears.</p>

<p>When Telemachus saw the steward he beckoned
him to the table and sat beside him while he ate.
But Ulysses crouched down by the threshold.
Telemachus gave bread and meat to the swineherd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, Eum&aelig;us,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;give these broken
meats to that poor old beggar man by the gate,
and tell him from me that if he lacks he should be
bold and go to the princes and ask them for alms.
By Zeus! he will never grow fat if he crouches by
the door there!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
Ulysses took the food with a low bow and
packed it away in his wallet.</p>

<p>He rose up grasping his staff, and went tottering
among the suitors. His lean arms and
furrowed, wrinkled face were so piteous, his
whining appeal full of such misery, that many of
the princes tossed him something.</p>

<p>At the head of the table a tall and splendid
young man was sitting. He was richly dressed in
a showy, ostentatious manner. His florid, handsome
face wore a perpetual and evil sneer. His
grey eyes were ill-tempered and quarrelsome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the gods, my friends,&rdquo; he cried, with a sneer,
&ldquo;how tender-hearted and compassionate you are
grown! With what lavishness do you bestow the
wealth of Ulysses, or rather of the queen, upon this
old scarecrow. Such old beasts are no use in this
world. Get you gone, you old dog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he hurled a three-legged stool at
Ulysses. The stool struck him a heavy blow on
his side.</p>

<p>For a moment the black turmoil in the hero&rsquo;s
heart was almost irrepressible. But with an
enormous effort of will he overcame it. He stood
quite still, with his head sunk upon his breast in
humility.</p>

<p>Now came the girls from out of the house
carrying great jars of fresh wine, and copper
bowls of water for the mixing, which they put upon
the table.</p>

<p>Here was better sport than an old beggar and his
woes, and Ulysses moved aside and was forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
But one of the girls touched him on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Wanderer,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the Queen Penelope has
seen how Antinous used you from her room
within the hall, and she sends me to summon you
to her, for she would speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, with beating heart and footsteps which
trembled with no simulated age, the king followed
the girl over the threshold of his own palace.</p>

<p>As he was walking towards the chamber of the
queen an old woman came towards them, a very
old woman with a lined brown face and little,
brilliant twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is a shame that
they should use your grey hairs so, and abuse
the hospitality which is the sacred right of
strangers. My lady Penelope sends me to you,
and bids me wash your feet in this bowl of water,
so that we may purge our house of the stain the
prince without has cast upon it. Sit on this
stool and I will lave ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old nurse Euryclea bathed the feet of
her master whom she had dandled in her arms as
a child. Suddenly Ulysses made as though he
would draw away his foot. He remembered that
on his leg he bore a strange-shaped scar made by
a savage boar when he was a boy, and he feared
the wise old woman would know him by that
mark.</p>

<p>But as she passed her hand along his ankle
she touched the mark and turned his foot towards
the light and saw it. She dropped his foot quickly,
and the basin was overturned and the water ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
away over the marble floor. She looked up into
the king&rsquo;s face and knew him for all his
disguise.</p>

<p>In a fierce, hurried whisper he bade her be silent
for her life and his and the queen&rsquo;s safety. As she
vowed, trembling, by Zeus and the gods, to do his
bidding, a trumpet snarled suddenly outside on
the steps of the palace.</p>

<p>The riot without died into silence.</p>

<p>The clear cold voice of a herald began to speak.</p>

<p>Thus says the Queen Penelope: &ldquo;To-morrow
will I make an end of all. In the forenoon I will
choose from among the princes whom I will wed.
Too long have ye rioted within the palace and
eaten up the substance of myself and my son. I
am aweary. And since there is no other way,
to-morrow I will choose. Ye shall take the great
bow of the King Ulysses from its cover. And he
who can shoot an arrow through twelve axes in a
row&mdash;even as Ulysses was wont to do&mdash;him will I
wed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nurse!&rdquo; whispered Ulysses, &ldquo;the king will
be here before any can bend that bow. Now go
into the queen and tell her that the old man is
sick and begs leave to wait upon her another time.
And comfort her with an omen that you have seen,
but tell her nothing. And now farewell. There is
much to do ere dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>There was a silence of consternation in the great
banqueting hall of the palace.</p>

<p>Penelope from her seat upon the raised steps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
beneath the richly-decorated wall at the end
smiled faintly to herself.</p>

<p>The twelve axes stood in a row, driven into
sockets in the pavement. The suitors stood in
two long rows on either side.</p>

<p>Antinous, the strongest of them all, held a great
polished bow. His face blazed with anger and was
red with shame.</p>

<p>All eyes were centred on him. No one saw old
Eum&aelig;us steal out into the porch and silently lower
the heavy bars of the door and lash them tight
with cords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Antinous, &ldquo;I know now why
neither any of you nor I myself can bend this
bow. It is not the great strength of Ulysses, for I
am stronger than he ever was. This is Apollo&rsquo;s
festival, the Archer-God, and it is useless to strive
to bend this bow to-day. Let us sacrifice to
Helios to-day, and then to-morrow come again
to the trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the old beggar man came forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I pray you give me the bow,
since you have done your trial for to-day. I was
once strong in my youth. Let me have this
honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Antinous scowled at him, and stepped toward
him to strike such insolence, but the clear voice of
Penelope called sharply down the lane of men,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who insults even the meanest in my palace?
Have more regard, sir, for I am still queen here.
Give the old man the bow since that is his whim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Antinous was cowed, but still murmured, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
Telemachus stepped quickly up to him. The boy
seemed taller, his eyes shone with a cold, fierce
light they had never seen in them before. His
voice rang with a new authority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent, sir!&rdquo; he said in a keen, threatening
voice. &ldquo;The bow is mine, and mine alone, to give
or refuse as I decide. Mother, the trial is over for
to-day. Go with your maidens into your own
chamber. I will see to this old man, and I am
master here and will be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a frightened pride and wonder the queen
withdrew.</p>

<p>The suitors began to whisper to each other,
wondering what this might mean. Their confidence
seemed to be slipping away from them.
Each and all felt uneasy. There was some strange
influence in the air which sapped their courage and
silenced the loud insolent words which were ever
on their lips.</p>

<p>The shadow of death was creeping into the
hall.</p>

<p>The great marble room suddenly grew cold.
The old beggar came up to the splendid Antinous
and took the bow from his unresisting hand.</p>

<p>As he plucked the string the gods spake at last.
A crash of thunder pealed among them. There
was a moment&rsquo;s silence, and then the bow-string
rang beneath the hero&rsquo;s touch as clear as the note
of a swallow.</p>

<p>And in a strange light, which glowed out from
the walls and great pillars of bronze, the princes
saw no beggar, but a noble form with bronzed face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
and flashing eyes, and they knew the king had
come home again.</p>

<p>Ulysses motioned to his son, and Telemachus
drew his sword and with a great shout rushed up
the hall after his father.</p>

<p>They turned and stood on the steps.</p>

<p>An arrow sang like a flying wasp, and Antinous
lay dying on the floor.</p>

<p>Then the princes rushed to the walls where
their armour and swords were wont to hang, but
all the pegs were bare.</p>

<p>Only above the steps where Ulysses stood were
three spears and three shields, and as they gazed
in cold fear Eum&aelig;us leapt upon the steps and the
three girded on the armour.</p>

<p>Again the great bow sang, and Amphinomus
lay dead.</p>

<p>Then Telemachus with a great shout drove his
spear through the fat Ctessipus, and he fell gurgling
his life away.</p>

<p>But one of the suitors, Melanthius, climbed up
a pillar through one of the lanterns of the hall and
clambered over the roofs to the armoury unseen
by Ulysses.</p>

<p>And while the deadly arrows sped with bitter
mocking words towards the cowering throng, he
gathered a great sheaf of spears and flung them
down among his comrades.</p>

<p>They seized upon the spears with a fierce cry of
joy, and Ulysses&rsquo; heart failed him where he stood
for there were still many living.</p>

<p>They began to run up the hall towards the steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
Then at last Athene saw that her time had
come, and she lifted her terrible war shield which
brings death to the sons of men.</p>

<p>And the flight of spears all went far wide of
the mark, and some fell with a rattle upon the
floor.</p>

<p>With one cry of triumph the king leapt like
light among the crowd. Hither and there flashed
the three swords like swooping vultures, and
Athene took all power from the princes, and one
by one they screamed and met their doom.</p>

<p>And soon the din of battle died away, and save
for a faint moaning the hall was silent.</p>

<p>And the princes, the pride of the islands, lay
fallen in dust and blood, heaped one on the other,
like a great catch of fishes turned out from a
fisherman&rsquo;s nets upon the shore.</p>

<p>Eum&aelig;us went to the door of the hall and cut
the lashings, and raised the bars so that the sunlight
came slanting in great beams. The dust
danced in the light rays like a powder of tiny
lives.</p>

<p>Then Ulysses called the servants and bade
them carry the bodies away. And he ordered
Euryclea to wash the blood-stained floors, and
to bring sulphur and torches that the place might
be purified.</p>

<p>And that night great beacons flared on the hills,
and far out to sea the fishermen saw them and
said, &ldquo;Surely the king has come home again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And while the music rang though the lighted
palace and the people passed before the gates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
shouting for joy, old Euryclea spread the
marriage bed of the king by the light of flaming
torches.</p>

<p>And when all was prepared, the old nurse went
to Ulysses and Penelope and led them to the
door of the marriage chamber, as she had led
them twenty years before.</p>

<p>Then the music ceased in the palace halls and
silence fell over all the house.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span></p>

<h2>A NOTE ON
HOMER AND ULYSSES</h2>


<p>The uncertainty which prevails as to the actual birthplace
of Homer also extends to the exact period at which he
flourished. Doubts have been expressed by some modern
scholars as to whether the poet ever existed as a personality.
The view that the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> were not the
work of an individual, but merely a collection of old folklore
verse welded into a whole by many hands, made
compact by ages, a self-born epic rising from crystallised
tradition, is, however, not a tenable one, and need not be
discussed here.</p>

<p>As far as we are able to place the poet in his period
correctly, we can say with some certainty that he flourished
at a time between 800 and 900 years before the birth
of Christ.</p>

<p>The Arundelian marbles fix his era at 907 years before
the dawn of Christianity. About the life of the most
ancient of all poets nothing whatever is known. There is a
tradition that he had a school of followers in the Island
of Chios, and we have early records of celebrations held
there in his honour every few years. But no proof whatever
exists of the truth of the supposition, though up
to quite modern times the islanders maintained and
believed in it.</p>

<p>In the same way must be treated the story of Homer&rsquo;s
blindness. It is a legend which cannot be proved or
disproved. Yet at a time when literature must have
been almost purely oral, his blindness need have been no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
bar to the exercise of his talent. It has been said, and
the theory is at least an interesting one, that the music
and sonance of Homer&rsquo;s lines came from the fact that
they were composed to be <em>spoken</em> rather than <em>read</em>. That
the blindness of Milton did not in any way detract from
the grandeur of his verse is an undoubted fact, and yet
Milton had to <em>speak</em> every line before he could have it
recorded by others.</p>

<p>We can deduce something of Homer from his work.
That he must have been a travelled man seems indubitable.
To this day the modern Ulysses or Menelaus,
standing on the bridge of his tramp steamer, can see
the headlands, islands, and capes, unchanged from 3000
years ago. That Homer was a man of deep feeling, was
possessed of the &ldquo;artistic temperament&rdquo; in a very marked
degree, seems equally clear. Nothing can be more
delicate and touching than his handling of Penelope.
Other ancient writers have represented the wife of Ulysses
as an abandoned harlot, and said that her husband repudiated
her for incontinence during his absence. Homer,
with a far surer, finer touch, made her a model for wives
to emulate and husbands to desire. The whole of the
home-coming scenes in the <i>Odyssey</i> could only have been
written by a man who was no mere materialist.</p>

<p>When Homer wrote, human nature was much less profound
a thing than it has since become. And yet, though
men&rsquo;s motives were entirely different, men&rsquo;s actions sprang
from less subtle causes than now. Homer was a psychologist
of the first class. He knew his fellow-men. In all
Romance no one can point to a finer and more consistent
character-study than that of Ulysses. Shakespeare has
drawn no more vivid picture of a single temperament.
Homer must have mixed with mankind, observed them
closely, been an acute and untiring observer.</p>

<p>The absolutely original temper of his mind is extraordinary.
For we must remember that Homer could
hardly have had any models to inform his choice of
subjects or direct his style. Yet none of his imitators,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
and there have been many, were able, even in their
happiest moments, even to approach him. As he was
the first poet, so he was the greatest, and we may well
conclude he will remain so until men themselves are
things of the past.</p>

<p>In the ancient world, when we get into the actual
periods of recorded history, we find a worship of Homer
universally existing. His works reposed under the pillow
of Alexander together with the sword which had made
him great. The conqueror enshrined the <i>Iliad</i> in the
richest casket of the vanquished Persian king. Altars
smoked in Homer&rsquo;s honour all over Greece, he was
venerated as a god. But speculations about Homer
have, after all, but little value. We know nothing, and
we shall never now know anything about him.</p>

<p>He remains a glorious and mysterious fact. We have
the priceless legacy of this Being, and that is enough.</p>


<h3>ULYSSES</h3>

<p>Even Euclid, the inventor of concrete logical processes,
is forced to begin with axioms and definitions that are
absurd. Once allow them, and everything proceeds to
a brilliant triumph of mentality; but in order to build
a basis in a vacuum, one has to swallow a dose of
nonsense first.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that in order to estimate the
character-drawing employed by Homer to create Ulysses,
we must swallow the supernatural influences which surrounded
him. Put them out of the question and the hero
lacks perspective and becomes a doll. Let it be granted
that Minerva stood beside the wanderer. &ldquo;Her clear
and bared limbs o&rsquo;erthwarted with the brazen-headed
spear.&rdquo; Let us but believe with Homer that the careless
Gods lie beside their nectar on the hill, and hurl their
bolts far below into the valleys of men, then the man
Ulysses shines out clear and full of colour, an absolute
achievement in Art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
An ancient Norse pick-axe has been discovered, bearing
the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem21">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Either I will find a way or make one</i>,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and a broken helmet was once found in Battle Abbey,
engraved with this crest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem13">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;espoir est ma force.</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Master Mariner might have owned them both.
The first quality which we marvel at in our analysis of
Ulysses&rsquo; character is the extraordinary <em>resource</em> which he
displays throughout all his wanderings. His qualities of
passive endurance, his enormous courage, his mental
agility&mdash;the very cream of cunning, are all component
parts of his unfailing readiness to take sudden advantage
of his opportunity. For him all tides were at flood to
lead on to fortune.</p>

<p>Charybdis sucks down his stout ship into the womb of
the sea, he makes a raft of the restored keel.</p>

<p>He estimates the brain power of the stupid Cyclops at
its exact value, and escapes the vengeance of his companions
by a pun. And there is a well-defined touch of
fatalism in Ulysses also. When the irreparable blunder
has been committed by his sailors, and Apollo&rsquo;s sacred
beeves are smoking on the spit, he knows that he and
all his men must pay heavily for their disregard of Circe&rsquo;s
warning. It is inevitable. Nothing can turn aside the
coming anger of the Sun-God. So Ulysses, being hungry,
though innocent of the initial sacrilege, makes his unhallowed
meal with the rest. He must endure the pain,
so plucks the pelf also. To enlarge upon his courage
and endurance were unnecessary. The <i>Odyssey</i> is one
long p&aelig;an of them both. His sagacity is manifest so
vividly in all his actions that even Zeus, father of
Heaven, says to Athene, &ldquo;<i>No, daughter, I could never
forget Ulysses, the wisest worldling of them all</i>.&rdquo; But
what of Ulysses as a Sybarite? The hero &ldquo;Mulierose,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
to borrow from the <i>Cloister and the Hearth</i>, the lover of
ladies, &ldquo;propt on beds of amaranth and moly,&rdquo; while white
enchanted arms hold him a willing captive? I have heard
it remarked that here the Ionian father of poets has gone
astray. People have said to me that Ulysses loved his
wife too well to dwell contented on the spicy downs of
Lotos Land, that he was too taut and hardy a man. But
Homer did not err in his study of temperament.</p>

<p>How can one judge the man of 3000 years ago by the
standards of to-day? In the ages when hosts joined in
battle for the fair body of Helen men looked on women
with other eyes than ours. Heaven and hell were very
material places, pleasure was a very material, tangible,
understandable thing and a lovely woman a gift from the
Gods.</p>

<p>Ulysses strove for Ithaca through storm and wrack, and
when Fortune sent him to Calypso, or beached his ship on
Circe&rsquo;s fairy isle, he was content to rest a little while.
He yielded, like others of the wise. Socrates studied
under Aspasia, and Aspasia ruled the world under the
name of Pericles.</p>

<p>It is in trying to fit the temperament of an ancient to
a modern that the majority of people must always fail to
understand a great piece of contemporary literature. One
may sift the instances of modern temperament and comment
on them, but one should not try to mould the residue
into a like form. The Bible story paints King David, for
example, as a truculent, bloodthirsty, canting monster&mdash;a
complete portrait. The immorality and stupidity lies
in trying to reconcile his Old Testament enormities with
the revelations of the New.</p>

<p>So with Ulysses, Circe, Calypso, Nausicaa, and even
in later years the legendary Erippe, all fall truly, artistically
and naturally into the mosaic of the hero&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>One interesting point in the pleasure-loving side of
Ulysses&rsquo; nature should by no means be disregarded. Not
only did he take eagerly such joys as the Fates apportioned,
but he was a true and discriminating Sybarite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
We find him taking stringent precautions against
disaster from the Sirens, yet determined to enjoy the
luxury of their song. It is a pleasure not to be missed
and not to be paid for. In after years we may imagine
him relating his unique and delicious experience to his
friends with an undoubted complacency.</p>

<p>In the commendable and ancient virtues of filial love,
a cardinal virtue in the old world, a forgotten duty to-day,
Ulysses was singularly strong. His tenderest inquiries
in Hades, the most passionate expressions of affection, are
protested to the shade of Anticlea, his mother. One of
the most touching scenes in the <i>Odyssey</i> is the meeting
between Ulysses and Laertes, his father, after the long
wanderings are over. &ldquo;<i>He flung his arms around his
father and cried out, &lsquo;Oh, my father, I am here indeed
once more. I have come back to you at last! Dry your
tears, for mine is the victory.&rsquo;</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A many-sided man. Hard as a diamond and as bright,
with every facet in his many-sided nature cut and polished
by the hand of a master.</p>
